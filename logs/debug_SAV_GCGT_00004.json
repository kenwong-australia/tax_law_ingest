It is not a separate tax, merely a component of your income tax. You are taxed on your net capital gain at your marginal tax rate.\n\nTo work out your net capital gain:\n\n\n\u2022Calculate your total capital gains for 2023-24.\n\u2022Subtract your total capital losses for 2023-24 and any unapplied capital losses from earlier income years.\n\u2022Subtract your entitlement to any CGT discount and small business CGT concessions.\n\n\n\n\nIf your total capital losses for 2023\u201324 are more than your total capital gains, the difference is your net capital loss for the year. You can carry it forward to later income years to be deducted from future capital gains. You can't deduct capital losses or a net capital loss from your other assessable income. There is no time limit on how long you can carry forward a net capital loss. You apply your net capital losses in the order that you make them.\n\nThere are special rules for capital losses made on\n[collectables](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCOLLECTABLES%22&PiT=99991231235958#COLLECTABLES)\n. You can't make a capital loss on a\n[personal use asset](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATPERSONALUSEASSETS%22&PiT=99991231235958#PERSONALUSEASSETS)\n.\n\nIf you are completing a tax return for an individual and want more information on how to apply your capital losses, see\n[Instructions for individuals completing their tax return](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATC4%22&PiT=99991231235958#C4)\n, steps 5 and 6. For more information for companies, trusts and funds or for completing the\n*CGT summary worksheet*\n, see\n[Capital gains tax schedule and instructions 2024, step 2](https://www.ato.gov.au/forms-and-instructions/capital-gains-tax-schedule-2024-instructions)\n.\n\n***Capital gain or capital loss***\n\nYou make a capital gain or capital loss if a CGT event happens. You can also make a capital gain if a managed fund or other trust distributes a capital gain to you.\n\nFor most CGT events your capital gain is the difference between your capital proceeds and the cost base of your CGT asset. For example, if you sell an asset for more than you paid for it, the difference is your capital gain. You make a capital loss if your reduced cost base of your CGT asset is greater than the capital proceeds.\n\nGenerally, you can disregard any capital gain or capital loss you make on an asset if you acquired it before 20 September 1985 (pre-CGT).\n\nFor more information, see\n[Exemptions and rollovers](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATEXEMPTIONSANDROLLOVERS1%22&PiT=99991231235958#EXEMPTIONSANDROLLOVERS1)\n.\n\nThere are special rules that apply when working out gains and losses from depreciating assets. A depreciating asset is a tangible asset (other than land or trading stock) that has a limited effective life. It can be expected to decline in value over the time it is used. Certain intangible assets are also depreciating assets.\n\nIf you use a depreciating asset for a taxable purpose (such as in a business) any gain you make on it is treated as ordinary income and any loss as a deduction. It is only when a depreciating asset is used for a non-taxable purpose (used privately) that you can make a capital gain or capital loss on it.\n\nFor more information, see\n[CGT and depreciating assets](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCGTANDDEPRECIATINGASSETS%22&PiT=99991231235958#CGTANDDEPRECIATINGASSETS)\n.\n\nTo work out whether you have to pay tax on your capital gains, you need to know:\n\n\n\u2022whether a CGT event has happened\n\u2022the time of the CGT event\n\u2022what assets are subject to CGT\n\u2022how to calculate the capital gain or capital loss\n\n\n-how to determine your capital proceeds, cost base and reduced cost base\n-how to apply capital losses and the methods available to calculate a capital gain\n\n\n\n\u2022whether there is any exemption or rollover that allows you to reduce or disregard the capital gain or capital loss\n\u2022whether the CGT discount applies\n\u2022whether you are entitled to any of the small business CGT concessions.\n\n\n\n\n**What is a CGT event?**\n\nCGT events are the different types of transactions or events that may result in a capital gain or capital loss. Many CGT events involve a CGT asset; some relate directly to capital receipts (capital proceeds).\n\nYou need to know which type of CGT event applies in your situation. It affects how you calculate your capital gain or capital loss and when you include it in your net capital gain or net capital loss.\n\nThe range of CGT events is wide. Some happen often and affect many people while others are rare and affect only a few people. There is a summary of the various types of CGT events at\n[Appendix 1](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATA1%22&PiT=99991231235958#A1)\n.\n\nThe most common CGT event happens if you dispose of a CGT asset to someone else, such as if you sell it or give it away, including to a relative.\n\nA CGT event also happens when:\n\n\n\u2022an asset you own is lost or destroyed (the destruction may be voluntary or involuntary)\n\u2022shares you own are cancelled, surrendered or redeemed\n\u2022you enter into an agreement not to work in a particular industry for a set period of time\n\u2022a trustee makes a non-assessable payment to you from a managed fund or other unit trusts (including a corporate collective investment vehicle (CCIV) sub-fund trust)\n\u2022you have an annual cost base reduction that exceeds the cost base of your interest in an attribution managed investment trust or attribution CCIV sub-fund trust\n\u2022a company makes a payment (not a dividend) to you as a shareholder\n\u2022a liquidator or administrator declares that shares or financial instruments you own are worthless\n\u2022you receive an amount from a local council for disruption to your business assets by roadworks\n\u2022you stop being an Australian resident\n\u2022you enter into a conservation covenant\n\u2022you dispose of a depreciating asset that you used for private purposes.\n\n\n\n\nSubdividing land does not result in a CGT event if you retain ownership of the subdivided blocks. Therefore, you don't make a capital gain or a capital loss at the time of the subdivision.\n\nAustralian residents make a capital gain or capital loss if a CGT event happens to any of their assets anywhere in the world. As a general rule, foreign residents make a capital gain or capital loss only if a CGT event happens to a CGT asset that is\n[taxable Australian property](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATTAXABLEAUSTRALIANPROPERTY%22&PiT=99991231235958#TAXABLEAUSTRALIANPROPERTY)\n.\n\n***Order in which CGT events apply***\n\nIf more than one CGT event happens, use the one that is most specific to your situation.\n\n***Time of the CGT event***\n\nThe timing of a CGT event is important because it determines in which income year you report your capital gain or capital loss.\n\nIf you dispose of a CGT asset to someone else, the CGT event happens when you enter into the contract for disposal. If there is no contract, the CGT event generally happens when you stop being the asset's owner.\n\n**Example 1: contract**\n> In June 2024, Sue enters into a contract to sell land. The contract settles in October 2024.\n\n> Sue makes the capital gain in 2023\u201324 (the income year in which she enters into the contract), not 2024\u201325 (the income year in which settlement takes place).\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a CGT asset you own is lost or destroyed, the CGT event happens when you first receive compensation for the loss or destruction. If you don't receive any compensation, the CGT event happens when the loss is discovered or the destruction occurred.\n\n**Example 2: insurance policy**\n> Laurie owned a rental property that was destroyed by fire in June 2022. He received a payment under an insurance policy in October 2023. The CGT event happened in October 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nCGT events relating to shares and units, and the times of the events, are dealt with in\n[Investments in shares and units](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATINVESTMENTSINSHARESANDUNITS%22&PiT=99991231235958#INVESTMENTSINSHARESANDUNITS)\n.\n\n**What is a CGT asset?**\n\nMany CGT assets are easily recognisable, for example, land, shares in a company, and units in a unit trust. Other CGT assets are not so well understood such as contractual rights, options, foreign currency, crypto assets and goodwill. All assets are subject to the CGT rules unless they are specifically excluded.\n\nOne example of a crypto asset is bitcoin. For more information on the tax treatment of crypto assets, see\n[Crypto asset investments](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Investments-and-assets/Crypto-asset-investments/)\n.\n\nCGT assets fall into one of 3 categories:\n\n\n\u2022[collectables](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCOLLECTABLES%22&PiT=99991231235958#COLLECTABLES)\n\u2022[personal use assets](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATPERSONALUSEASSETS%22&PiT=99991231235958#PERSONALUSEASSETS)\n\u2022[other assets.](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATOTHERASSETS1%22&PiT=99991231235958#OTHERASSETS1)\n\n\n\n\n***Collectables***\n\nCollectables include the following items that you use or keep mainly for the personal use or enjoyment of yourself or your associates:\n\n\n\u2022paintings, sculptures, drawings, engravings or photographs, reproductions of these items or property of a similar description or use\n\u2022jewellery\n\u2022antiques\n\u2022coins or medallions\n\u2022rare folios, manuscripts or books\n\u2022postage stamps or first day covers.\n\n\n\n\nA collectable is also:\n\n\n\u2022an interest in any of the items listed above\n\u2022a debt that arises from any of those items\n\u2022an option or right to acquire any of those items.\n\n\n\n\nYou can only use capital losses from collectables to reduce capital gains (including future capital gains) from collectables. You disregard\n**any**\ncapital gain or capital loss you make from a collectable if any of the following apply:\n\n\n\u2022you acquired the collectable for $500 or less\n\u2022you acquired an interest in the collectable for $500 or less before 16 December 1995\n\u2022you acquired an interest in the collectable when the asset had a market value of $500 or less.\n\n\n\n\nIf you dispose of a number of collectables individually that you would usually dispose of as a set, you are exempt from paying CGT only if you acquired the set for $500 or less. This does not apply to an individual collectable you acquired before 16 December 1995, which is exempt from CGT if you acquired it for $500 or less. This is irrespective of whether or not it would usually be disposed of as part of a set.\n\n***Personal use assets***\n\nA personal use asset is:\n\n\n\u2022a CGT asset, other than a collectable, that you use or keep mainly for the personal use or enjoyment of yourself or your associates\n\u2022an option or a right to acquire a personal use asset\n\u2022a debt resulting from a CGT event involving a CGT asset kept mainly for your personal use or enjoyment\n\u2022a debt resulting from you doing something other than gaining or producing your assessable income or carrying on a business.\n\n\n\n\nPersonal use assets may include such items as:\n\n\n\u2022boats\n\u2022furniture\n\u2022electrical goods\n\u2022household items\n\u2022crypto assets (if they are acquired and used in a short period of time mainly to purchase items for personal use or consumption).\n\n\n\n\nLand and buildings are not personal use assets. Any capital loss you make from a personal use asset is disregarded.\n\nIf a CGT event happened to a personal use asset, disregard any capital gain you make if you acquired the asset for $10,000 or less. If you disposed of personal use assets individually that would usually be sold as a set, you get the exemption only if you acquired the set for $10,000 or less.\n\n***Other assets***\n\nAssets that are not collectables or personal use assets include:\n\n\n\u2022land\n\u2022shares in a company\n\u2022rights and options\n\u2022leases\n\u2022units in a unit trust\n\u2022crypto assets (if they are acquired and held for some time before being used, or only a small proportion is used to buy items for personal use or consumption)\n\u2022goodwill\n\u2022licences\n\u2022convertible notes\n\u2022your home (see\n[Exemptions](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATEXEMPTIONS%22&PiT=99991231235958#EXEMPTIONS)\n)\n\u2022contractual rights\n\u2022foreign currency\n\u2022any major capital improvement made to certain land or pre-CGT assets.\n\n\n\n\n***Partnerships***\n\nIt is the individual partners who make a capital gain or capital loss from a CGT event, not the partnership itself. For CGT purposes, each partner owns a proportion of each CGT asset. Each partner calculates a capital gain or capital loss on their share of each asset and claims their share of a credit for foreign resident capital gains withholding amounts.\n\n***Tenants in common***\n\nIndividuals who own an asset as tenants in common may hold unequal interests in the asset. Each tenant in common makes a capital gain or capital loss from a CGT event in line with their interest in the asset. For example, a couple could own a rental property as tenants in common with one having a 20% interest and the other having an 80% interest. The capital gain or capital loss made when the rental property they dispose of (or another CGT event happens) is split between the individuals according to their legal interest in the property.\n\n***Joint tenants***\n\nFor CGT purposes, individuals who own an asset as joint tenants are each treated as if they own an equal interest in the asset as a\n[tenant in common](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATTENANTSINCOMMON%22&PiT=99991231235958#TENANTSINCOMMON)\n. Each joint tenant makes a capital gain or capital loss from a CGT event in line with their interest in the asset. For example, a couple owning a rental property as joint tenants split the capital gain or capital loss equally between them.\n\nWhen a joint tenant dies, their interest in the asset is taken to have been acquired in equal shares by the surviving joint tenants on the date of death.\n\n***Separate assets***\n\nFor CGT purposes, there are exceptions to the rule that what is attached to the land is part of the land. In some circumstances, a building or structure is considered to be a CGT asset separate from the land.\n\nImprovements to an asset (including land) acquired before 20 September 1985 may also be treated as a separate CGT asset.\n\nThis includes if you acquire land on or after 20 September 1985 which is adjacent to land you already own (purchased before 20 September 1985) and you amalgamate both pieces of land on one title.\n\n**Example 3: adjacent land**\n> On 1 April 1984 Dani bought a block of land. On 1 June 2024, she bought an adjacent block. Dani amalgamated the titles to the 2 blocks into one title.\n\n> The second block is treated as a separate CGT asset distinct from the first block. Since the second block was acquired on or after 20 September 1985 it is subject to the CGT provisions. Therefore, Dani can make a capital gain or loss from the second block when the whole area of land is sold.\n\n\n\n\n\n***Buildings, structures and other capital improvements to land you acquired on or after 20 September 1985***\n\nA building, structure or other capital improvement on land that you acquired on or after 20 September 1985 is a separate CGT asset, not part of the land, if a balancing adjustment provision applies to it. For example, a timber mill building is subject to a balancing adjustment if it is sold or destroyed, so it is treated as an asset separate from the land it is on.\n\n***Buildings and structures on land acquired before 20 September 1985***\n\nA building or structure on land that you acquired before 20 September 1985 is a separate asset if either:\n\n\n\u2022you entered into a contract for the construction of the building or structure on or after that date\n\u2022there was no contract for its construction, and construction began on or after that date.\n\n\n\n\n***Other capital improvements to pre-CGT assets***\n\nIf you make a capital improvement to a CGT asset you acquired before 20 September 1985, this improvement is treated as a separate asset. It is subject to CGT if, at the time a CGT event happens to the original asset, the cost base of the capital improvement is:\n\n\n\u2022more than the improvement threshold for the year in which the event happens (see\n[table 1](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATTABLE1%22&PiT=99991231235958#TABLE1)\n), and\n\u2022more than 5% of the amount of money and property you receive from the event.\n\n\n\n\nIf there is more than one capital improvement and they are related, they are treated as one separate CGT asset if the total of their cost bases is more than the threshold and more than 5% of the amount of money and property you receive from the event.\n\nThe improvement threshold is adjusted to take account of inflation. The thresholds for 1985\u201386 to 2023\u201324 are shown in\n**table 1.**\n\n\n\n\n*Table 1: Improvement thresholds for 1985\u201386 to 2023\u201324*\n  \n\n| Income year | Threshold  $ |\n| 1985\u201386 | 50,000 |\n| 1986\u201387 | 53,950 |\n| 1987\u201388 | 58,859 |\n| 1988\u201389 | 63,450 |\n| 1989\u201390 | 68,018 |\n| 1990\u201391 | 73,459 |\n| 1991\u201392 | 78,160 |\n| 1992\u201393 | 80,036 |\n| 1993\u201394 | 80,756 |\n| 1994\u201395 | 82,290 |\n| 1995\u201396 | 84,347 |\n| 1996\u201397 | 88,227 |\n| 1997\u201398 | 89,992 |\n| 1998\u201399 | 89,992 |\n| 1999\u20132000 | 91,072 |\n| 2000\u201301 | 92,802 |\n| 2001\u201302 | 97,721 |\n| 2002\u201303 | 101,239 |\n| 2003\u201304 | 104,377 |\n| 2004\u201305 | 106,882 |\n| 2005\u201306 | 109,447 |\n| 2006\u201307 | 112,512 |\n| 2007\u201308 | 116,337 |\n| 2008\u201309 | 119,594 |\n| 2009\u201310 | 124,258 |\n| 2010\u201311 | 126,619 |\n| 2011\u201312 | 130,418 |\n| 2012\u201313 | 134,200 |\n| 2013\u201314 | 136,884 |\n| 2014\u201315 | 140,443 |\n| 2015\u201316 | 143,392 |\n| 2016\u201317 | 145,401 |\n| 2017\u201318 | 147,582 |\n| 2018\u201319 | 150,386 |\n| 2019\u201320 | 153,093 |\n| 2020\u201321 | 155,849 |\n| 2021\u201322 | 156,784 |\n| 2022\u201323 | 162,899 |\n| 2023\u201324 | 174,465 |\n\n\n\n**What are capital proceeds?**\n\nWhatever you receive as a result of a CGT event are your 'capital proceeds'. For most CGT events, your capital proceeds are an amount of money or the value of any property you either:\n\n\n\u2022receive\n\u2022are entitled to receive.\n\n\n\n\nIf you receive (or are entitled to receive) foreign currency, you work out the capital proceeds by converting it to Australian currency at the time of the relevant CGT event.\n\nIf you receive property (including shares) subject to a deed of escrow (which imposes a restriction on dealing in that property), you include the market value of the property at the time of the relevant CGT event in your capital proceeds.\n\nYou reduce your capital proceeds from a CGT event if:\n\n\n\u2022you are not likely to receive some or all of the proceeds\n\u2022the non-receipt of some or all of the proceeds is not due to anything you have done or failed to do\n\u2022you took all reasonable steps to get payment.\n\n\n\n\nProvided you are not entitled to a tax deduction for the amount you repaid, your capital proceeds are also reduced by:\n\n\n\u2022any part of the proceeds that you repay, or\n\u2022any compensation you pay that can reasonably be regarded as a repayment of the proceeds.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are registered for GST and you receive payment when you dispose of a CGT asset, any GST payable is not part of the capital proceeds.\n\n***Market value substitution rule***\n\nIn some cases, if you receive nothing in exchange for a CGT asset (because you give it away as a gift), you are taken to have received the market value of the asset at the time of the CGT event. You may also be taken to have received the market value if:\n\n\n\u2022your capital proceeds are more or less than the market value of the CGT asset, and\n\u2022you and the purchaser were not dealing with each other at arm's length in connection with the event.\n\n\n\n\nThis is known as the\n**market value substitution rule**\nfor capital proceeds.\n\nYou are said to be dealing at arm's length with someone if each party acts independently and neither party exercises influence or control over the other in connection with the transaction. The law looks not only at the relationship between the parties but also at the quality of the bargaining between them.\n\n**Example 4: gifting an asset**\n> On 7 May 2008, Martha and Stephen bought a block of land.\n\n> In November 2023, they complete a transfer form to have the block transferred to their adult son, Paul, as a gift.\n\n> Because they received nothing for it, Martha and Stephen are taken to have received the market value of the land at the time it was transferred to Paul.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe market value substitution rule for capital proceeds is subject to some exceptions. For example, the substitution rule for capital proceeds does not apply to the following examples of\n[CGT event C2](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATTABLEENDOFCGTASSET%22&PiT=99991231235958#TABLEENDOFCGTASSET)\n(about cancellation, surrender and similar endings):\n\n\n\u2022the expiry of a CGT asset that the taxpayer owns\n\u2022the cancellation of a statutory licence held by the taxpayer.\n\n\n\n\nIt also does not apply where CGT event C2 happens for interests held in companies and unit trusts that:\n\n\n\u2022have at least 300 members or unit holders\n\u2022don't have concentrated ownership.\n\n\n\n\nIt also does not apply if you are a complying superannuation fund, a complying approved deposit fund or a pooled superannuation trust if both of the following apply:\n\n\n\u2022the capital proceeds from the CGT event exceed the market value of the CGT asset\n\u2022assuming the capital proceeds were your statutory income, the proceeds would be non-arm's length income.\n\n\n\n\nThere are special rules for calculating the proceeds from a depreciating asset.\n\nIf the\n[taxation of financial arrangements (TOFA)](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/corporate-tax-measures-and-assurance/taxation-of-financial-arrangements-tofa/in-detail/guide-to-the-taxation-of-financial-arrangements-tofa)\nrules apply to you, there are special rules for calculating proceeds from a CGT asset, where you start or cease to have a financial arrangement as consideration for providing that CGT asset.\n\nFor more information, see:\n\n\n\u2022[Transferring property to family or friends](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/corporate-tax-measures-and-assurance/taxation-of-financial-arrangements-tofa/in-detail/guide-to-the-taxation-of-financial-arrangements-tofa)\n\u2022[CGT and depreciating assets](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCGTANDDEPRECIATINGASSETS%22&PiT=99991231235958#CGTANDDEPRECIATINGASSETS)\n\n\n\n\n**What is the cost base?**\n\nThe cost base of a CGT asset is generally the cost of the asset when you bought it. It also includes certain other costs associated with acquiring, holding and disposing of the asset.\n\nFor most CGT events, you need the cost base of the CGT asset to work out whether you have made a capital gain. If you may have made a capital loss, you need the reduced cost base of the CGT asset for your calculation. The columns labelled 'Capital gain' and 'Capital loss' in the tables at\n[Appendix 1](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATA1%22&PiT=99991231235958#A1)\nindicate whether the cost base and reduced cost base of an asset are relevant for a CGT event.\n\nIf they are not relevant, the same columns in the tables explain how to work out your capital gain or loss. For example, if you enter into an agreement not to work in a particular industry for a set period of time, CGT event D1 specifies that you calculate your capital gain or capital loss by comparing the capital proceeds with the incidental costs.\n\nCost base is not relevant when working out a capital gain from a depreciating asset. There are special rules for calculating the cost of a depreciating asset.\n\nFor more information, see:\n\n\n\u2022[CGT and depreciating assets](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCGTANDDEPRECIATINGASSETS%22&PiT=99991231235958#CGTANDDEPRECIATINGASSETS)\n\u2022[Guide to depreciating assets 2024](https://www.ato.gov.au/forms-and-instructions/depreciating-assets-guide-2024)\n\n\n\n\n***Elements of the cost base***\n\nThe cost base of a CGT asset is made up of 5 elements:\n\n\n1.[money or property given for the asset](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATFIRSTELEMENTMONEYORPROPERTYGIVENFORTHEASSET%22&PiT=99991231235958#FIRSTELEMENTMONEYORPROPERTYGIVENFORTHEASSET)\n2.[incidental costs of acquiring the CGT asset or that relate to the CGT event](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATSECONDELEMENTINCIDENTALCOSTSOFACQUIRINGTHECGTASSETORTHATRELATETOTHECGTEVENT%22&PiT=99991231235958#SECONDELEMENTINCIDENTALCOSTSOFACQUIRINGTHECGTASSETORTHATRELATETOTHECGTEVENT)\n3.[costs of owning the asset](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATTHIRDELEMENTCOSTSOFOWNINGTHEASSET%22&PiT=99991231235958#THIRDELEMENTCOSTSOFOWNINGTHEASSET)\n4.[capital costs to increase or preserve the value of your asset or to install or move it](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATFOURTHELEMENTCAPITALCOSTSTOINCREASEORPRESERVETHEVALUEOFYOURASSETORTOINSTALLORMOVEIT%22&PiT=99991231235958#FOURTHELEMENTCAPITALCOSTSTOINCREASEORPRESERVETHEVALUEOFYOURASSETORTOINSTALLORMOVEIT)\n5.[capital costs of preserving or defending your ownership of or rights to your asset.](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATFIFTHELEMENTCAPITALCOSTSOFPRESERVINGORDEFENDINGYOUROWNERSHIPOFORRIGHTSTOYOURASSET%22&PiT=99991231235958#FIFTHELEMENTCAPITALCOSTSOFPRESERVINGORDEFENDINGYOUROWNERSHIPOFORRIGHTSTOYOURASSET)\n\n\n\n\nYou need to work out the amount for each element, then add them together to work out the cost base of your CGT asset.\n\nIf there is an amount paid in a foreign currency that is part of the cost base you should convert it to Australian currency at the time of the relevant transaction or event.\n\nIf you are registered for GST, reduce each element of the cost base of your asset by any related GST net input tax credits. If you are not registered for GST, you don't make any adjustments as the GST is included in the cost base.\n\n***First element: money or property given for the asset***\n\nInclude in the first element:\n\n\n\u2022the money paid (or required to be paid) for the asset\n\u2022the market value of property given (or required to be given) to acquire the asset.\n\n\n\n\n***Second element: incidental costs of acquiring the CGT asset or that relate to the CGT event***\n\nThere are 10 incidental costs you may have incurred in acquiring the asset or for the CGT event that happens to it, including its disposal. They are:\n\n\n1.remuneration for the services of a surveyor, valuer, auctioneer, accountant, broker, agent, consultant or legal adviser (you can include the cost of advice concerning the operation of the tax law as an incidental cost only if the advice was provided by a recognised tax adviser and you incurred the cost after 30 June 1989)\n2.costs of transfer\n3.stamp duty or other similar duty\n4.costs of advertising or marketing (but not entertainment) to find a seller or buyer\n5.costs relating to the making of any valuation or apportionment to determine your capital gain or capital loss\n6.search fees relating to an asset (such as fees to check land titles and similar fees, but not travel costs to find an asset suitable for purchase)\n7.the cost of a conveyancing kit (or a similar cost)\n8.borrowing expenses (such as loan application fees and mortgage discharge fees)\n9.expenditure that\n\n\na.is incurred by the head company of a consolidated group to an entity that is not a member of the group\nb.reasonably relates to a CGT asset held by the head company\nc.is incurred because of a transaction that is between members of the group\n\n\n\n10.expenditure that is incurred as a direct result of your ownership of a CGT asset ending (also known as termination, exit or similar fees).\n\n\n\n\nYou don't include costs if you:\n\n\n\u2022have claimed a tax deduction for them in any year\n\u2022omitted to claim a deduction but can still claim it because the period for amending the relevant income tax assessment has not expired.\n\n\n\n\n***Third element: costs of owning the asset***\n\nThe costs of owning an asset include rates, land taxes, repairs and insurance premiums. Non-deductible interest on borrowings to finance a loan used to acquire a CGT asset and on loans used to finance capital expenditure you incur to increase an asset's value are also third element costs.\n\nYou don't include such costs if you acquired the asset before 21 August 1991. Nor do you include them if you:\n\n\n\u2022have claimed a tax deduction for them in any income year\n\u2022omitted to claim a deduction but can still claim it because the period for amending the relevant income tax assessment has not expired.\n\n\n\n\nYou can't include them at all in the cost base of collectables or personal use assets.\n\nYou can't index these costs or use them to work out a capital loss.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Indexation of the cost base](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATOTHERADJUSTMENTSTOTHECOSTBASE%22&PiT=99991231235958#OTHERADJUSTMENTSTOTHECOSTBASE)\n.\n\n***Fourth element: capital costs to increase or preserve the value of your asset or to install or move it***\n\nThe fourthth element is capital costs you incurred for the purpose or the expected effect of increasing or preserving the asset's value. For example, costs incurred in applying (successfully or unsuccessfully) for zoning changes. It also includes capital costs you incurred that relate to installing or moving the asset. It does\n**not**\ninclude capital expenditure incurred for goodwill, which may be deductible as a business-related cost.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Guide to depreciating assets 2024](https://www.ato.gov.au/forms-and-instructions/depreciating-assets-guide-2024)\n.\n\n***Fifth element: capital costs of preserving or defending your ownership of or rights to your asset***\n\nCapital expenses you incur to preserve or defend your ownership of, or rights to, the asset come under this element \u2013 for example, you paid a call on shares.\n\n***Other adjustments to the cost base***\n\nOther adjustments include:\n\n\n\u2022Assets acquired after 13 May 1997 If you acquired a CGT asset after 13 May 1997, the cost base of the asset excludes\n\n\n-any expenditure in the first, fourth or fifth element for which you have claimed a tax deduction in any income year, or have omitted to claim but can still claim as a deduction because the period for amending the relevant income tax assessment has not expired\n-heritage conservation expenditure and Landcare and water facilities expenditure incurred after 12 November 1998 that give rise to a tax offset. Special rules apply for land and buildings. For more information, see\n[Cost base adjustments for capital works deductions](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCOSTBASEADJUSTMENTSFORCAPITALWORKSDEDUCTIONS%22&PiT=99991231235958#COSTBASEADJUSTMENTSFORCAPITALWORKSDEDUCTIONS)\n.\n\n\n\n\u2022Reversal of deduction: effect on cost base In some cases, a deduction you have claimed on a CGT asset can be partly or wholly 'reversed'. This means that part or all of the deduction may be included in your assessable income in the income year the CGT event happens. In this case, you increase the cost base of the CGT asset by the amount you have to include in your assessable income.\n\u2022Indexation of the cost base If a CGT event happened to a CGT asset you acquired at or before 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999, you can use either the indexation method or the discount method to calculate your capital gain. If you use the indexation method, some of the cost base expenditure you incurred up to this time may be indexed to account for inflation up to the September 1999 quarter. Only expenditure incurred before this time may be indexed because changes to the law mean indexation was frozen at that date.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, see\n[How to work out your capital gain or capital loss](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATHOWTOWORKOUTYOURCAPITALGAINORCAPITALLOSS%22&PiT=99991231235958#HOWTOWORKOUTYOURCAPITALGAINORCAPITALLOSS)\n.\n\n**What is the reduced cost base?**\n\nWhen a CGT event happens to a CGT asset and you haven't made a capital gain, you need the asset's reduced cost base to work out whether you have made a capital loss. Remember, you can use a capital loss to reduce capital gains only, you can't use it to reduce other income.\n\n***Elements of the reduced cost base***\n\nThe reduced cost base of a CGT asset has the same 5 elements as the\n[cost base](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATWHATISTHECOSTBASE%22&PiT=99991231235958#WHATISTHECOSTBASE)\n, except for the third element:\n\n\n1.money or property given for the asset\n2.incidental costs of acquiring the CGT asset or that relate to the CGT event\n3.balancing adjustment amount (any amount that is assessable because of a balancing adjustment for the asset or that would be assessable if certain balancing adjustment relief were not available)\n4.capital costs to increase or preserve the value of your asset or to install or move it\n5.capital costs of preserving or defending your ownership of or rights to your asset.\n\n\n\n\nThese elements are not indexed.\n\nYou need to work out the amount for each element, then add the amounts together to find out your reduced cost base for the relevant CGT asset.\n\nIf you are registered for GST, you reduce each element of the reduced cost base of the asset by the amount of any GST net input tax credits for that element. If you are not registered for GST you don't make any adjustment and the GST paid is included in the reduced cost base.\n\nThe reduced cost base does not include any costs you:\n\n\n\u2022have incurred for which you have claimed a tax deduction\n\u2022have omitted to claim, but can still claim, a deduction because the period for amending the relevant income tax assessment has not expired \u2013 for example, capital works deductions for capital expenditure.\n\n\n**Example 5: capital works deduction: effect on reduced cost base**\n> Danuta acquired a new income-producing asset on 28 September 2006 for $100,000. She sold it for $90,000 in November 2023. During the period she owned it, she claimed capital works deductions of $7,500. Her capital loss is worked out as follows.\n\n> 1. The cost base is $100,000.\n\n> 2.\n> *Subtract*\n> capital works deductions of $7,500:\n> \n> `$100,000 - $7,500 = $92,500`\n\n> 3. The\n> **reduced cost base is $92,500**\n> .\n\n> 4.\n> *Subtract*\n> the capital proceeds of $90,000:\n> \n> `$92,500 - $90,000 = $2,500`\n\n> 5. The\n> **capital loss is $2,500**\n\n\n\n\n\n**Modifications to the cost base and reduced cost base**\n\nIn some cases, the general rules for calculating the cost base and reduced cost base have to be modified. For example, you substitute the market value for the first element of the cost base and reduced cost base if:\n\n\n\u2022you didn't incur expenditure to acquire the asset\n\u2022some or all of the expenditure you incurred can't be valued\n\u2022you didn't deal at arm's length with the previous owner in acquiring the asset.\n\n\n\n\nThis is known as the market value substitution rule for cost base and reduced cost base.\n\nThere are exceptions to the market value substitution rule. One exception is where shares in a company, or units in a unit trust, are issued or allotted to you but you didn't pay anything for them.\n\nYou don't include expenditure you subsequently recoup (such as an insurance payout you receive or an amount paid for by someone else) in the cost base and reduced cost of a CGT asset except to the extent the recouped amount is included in your assessable income.\n\n**Example 6: Recouped expenditure**\n> John bought a building in 2000 for $200,000 and incurred $10,000 in legal costs associated with the purchase. As part of a settlement, the vendor agreed to pay $4,000 of the legal costs. John did not claim as a tax deduction any part of the $6,000 he paid in legal costs.\n\n> He later sells the building. As he received reimbursement of $4,000 of the legal costs, in working out his capital gain, he includes only the $6,000 he incurred in the cost base.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you acquire a CGT asset and only part of the expenditure relates to the acquisition of the CGT asset, you can only include that part of the expenditure that is reasonably attributable to the acquisition of the asset in its cost base and reduced cost base.\n\nApportionment is also required if you incur expenditure and only part of that expenditure relates to another element of the cost base and reduced cost base.\n\nSimilarly, if a CGT event happens only to part of your CGT asset, you generally apportion the asset's cost base and reduced cost base to work out the capital gain or capital loss from the CGT event.\n\n***General value shifting regime***\n\nValue shifting generally occurs when a dealing or transaction between 2 parties is not at market value. It results in the value of one asset decreasing and (usually) the value of another asset increasing.\n\nThe\n[general value shifting regime](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/corporate-tax-measures-and-assurance/consolidation/in-detail/general-value-shifting-regime/overview-of-provisions)\n(GVSR) rules apply to value shifts that arise:\n\n\n\u2022because interests in a company or trust are issued or bought back at other than market value, or because their rights are varied so that the value of some interests increases while the value of others decreases (direct value shifts on interests)\n\u2022because 2 entities under the same control or ownership conduct dealings or transactions that are neither at market value nor arm's length, so that the value of interests in one entity decreases while (usually) the value of interests in the other entity increases (indirect value shifting)\n\u2022from the creation of a right over a non-depreciating asset in favour of an associate for less than market value (direct value shifts by creating rights).\n\n\n\n\nThe rules on direct value shifts on interests target only equity or loan interests held by an individual or entity that controls the company or trust, the controller's associates and, if the company or trust is closely held, any active participants in the arrangement.\n\nThe indirect value shifting rules target only equity or loan interests held by an individual or entity that controls the 2 entities conducting the dealing or transaction and the controller's associates. But if the 2 entities are closely held, the rules also target equity or loan interests held by 2 or more common owners of those entities, the common owner's associates and any active participants in the arrangement.\n\nThere are also exclusions and safe harbours that limit the operation of the rules.\n\nIf the rules apply, you may need to adjust either:\n\n\n\u2022the cost base and reduced cost base of equity and loan interests affected by the value shift\n\u2022a realised loss or gain on the disposal of the relevant assets.\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases, there may also be an immediate capital gain.\n\nFor more information, see\n[General value shifting regime \u2013 who it affects](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/corporate-tax-measures-and-assurance/consolidation/in-detail/general-value-shifting-regime/who-it-affects)\n.\n\n***Other special rules***\n\nThere are other rules that may affect the cost base and reduced cost base of an asset \u2013 for example, they are calculated differently:\n\n\n\u2022if the asset is your main residence and you use it to produce income for the first time after 20 August 1996, see\n[Real estate and main residence](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATREALESTATEANDMAINRESIDENCE%22&PiT=99991231235958#REALESTATEANDMAINRESIDENCE)\n\u2022if you receive the asset as a beneficiary or as the legal personal representative of a deceased estate, see\n[Deceased estates](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATDECEASEDESTATES%22&PiT=99991231235958#DECEASEDESTATES)\n\u2022for bonus shares or units, rights and options and convertible notes, see\n[Investments in shares and units](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATINVESTMENTSINSHARESANDUNITS%22&PiT=99991231235958#INVESTMENTSINSHARESANDUNITS)\n\u2022under a\n[demerger](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATDEMERGERS1%22&PiT=99991231235958#DEMERGERS1)\n\u2022where you have been freed from paying a debt, see\n[Debt forgiveness](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATDEBTFORGIVENESS%22&PiT=99991231235958#DEBTFORGIVENESS)\nbelow\n\u2022where you start or cease to have a financial arrangement as consideration for acquiring a CGT asset, see\n[Guide to the taxation of financial arrangements (TOFA)](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/corporate-tax-measures-and-assurance/taxation-of-financial-arrangements-tofa/in-detail/guide-to-the-taxation-of-financial-arrangements-tofa)\n\u2022for eligible shares in an early stage innovation company (ESIC) that have been continuously held for 10 years or the subject of certain CGT rollovers, see\n[How does CGT apply to qualifying shares](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/income-deductions-and-concessions/incentives-and-concessions/tax-incentives-for-innovation/in-detail/tax-incentives-for-early-stage-investors/for-investors)\nand\n[How does the modified CGT treatment apply to a rollover?](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/income-deductions-and-concessions/incentives-and-concessions/tax-incentives-for-innovation/in-detail/tax-incentives-for-early-stage-investors/for-investors)\n.\n\n\n\n\n***Debt forgiveness***\n\nA debt is forgiven if you are freed from the obligation to pay it. Commercial debt forgiveness rules apply to debts forgiven after 27 June 1996. A debt is a commercial debt if part or all of the interest payable on the debt is, or would be, an allowable deduction.\n\nUnder the commercial debt forgiveness rules, a forgiven amount may reduce (in the following order) your:\n\n\n\u2022prior income year revenue losses\n\u2022net capital losses from earlier years\n\u2022deductions for capital allowances and some similar deductions\n\u2022assets' cost base and reduced cost base.\n\n\n\n\nThese rules don't apply if the debt is forgiven either:\n\n\n\u2022as a result of an action under bankruptcy law\n\u2022in a deceased person's will\n\u2022for reasons of natural love and affection.\n\n\n\n\nNor do the rules apply if:\n\n\n\u2022the debt is waived and the waiver constitutes a fringe benefit\n\u2022the amount of debt has been, or will be included in your assessable income in any income year\n\u2022the debt is a tax-related liability.\n\n\n**Example 7: applying a forgiven debt**\n> On 1 July 2023, Josef had available net capital losses from earlier years of $9,000. On 3 January 2024, he sold shares he had owned for more than 12 months for $20,000. They had a cost base (no indexation) of $7,500. On 1 April 2024, a commercial debt of $15,000 that Josef owed to AZC Pty Ltd was forgiven. Josef had no prior income year revenue losses and no deductible capital expenditure.\n\n> Josef must use part of the forgiven commercial debt amount to wipe out his net capital losses from earlier years and the rest to reduce the cost base of his shares. He works out the amount of net capital gain to include in his assessable income as follows:\n\n> **Adjust net capital losses from earlier years**\n\n> The available net capital losses from earlier years is $9,000.\n\n> *Subtract*\n> the debt forgiveness adjustment of $9,000:\n> \n> `$9,000 - $9,000 = $0`\n\n> The adjusted net capital losses from earlier years is\n> **$0**\n> (Zero).\n\n> **Step 2: Adjust cost base**\n\n> The cost base of shares (no indexation) is $7,500.\n\n> *Subtract*\n> the debt forgiveness adjustments of $6,000:\n> \n> `$7,500 - $6,000 = $1,500`\n\n> The adjusted cost base (no indexation) is $1,500.\n\n> **Step 3: Calculate net capital gain**\n\n> The sale of shares is $20,000.\n\n> *Subtract*\n> the adjusted cost base (no indexation) of $1,500:\n> \n> `$20,000 - $1,500 = $18,500`\n\n> *Subtract*\n> the adjusted net capital losses from earlier years of $0:\n> \n> `$18,500 - $0 = $18,500`\n\n> The capital gain (eligible for discount) is $18,500.\n\n> Subtract the discount percentage (50%) of $9,250:\n> \n> `$18,500 - $9,250 = $9,250`\n\n> The net capital gain is $9,250.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Acquiring CGT assets**\n\nGenerally, you acquire a CGT asset when you become its owner. You may acquire a CGT asset for the following reasons:\n\n\n\u2022Someone else has a CGT event (for example, the transfer of land to you under a contract of sale). If you acquired an asset because of a CGT event, you are generally taken to have acquired the asset at the time of the CGT event. For example, if you enter into a contract to purchase a CGT asset, the time of acquisition is when you enter into the contract. However, if you obtain an asset without entering into a contract, the time of acquisition is when you start being the asset's owner.\n\u2022Other events or transactions happen that are not the result of someone else having a CGT event. For example, if a company issues or allots shares to you (which is not a CGT event), you acquire the shares when you enter into a contract to acquire them or, if there is no contract, at the time of their issue or allotment.\n\u2022Other special CGT rules apply. For example, if a CGT asset passes to you as a beneficiary of someone who has died, you are taken to have acquired the asset on the date of the person's death. Also, if you start using your main residence to produce income for the first time after 20 August 1996, you are taken to have acquired it at its market value at the time it is first used to produce income.\n\n\n\n\n***Time of acquisition***\n\nThe time at which a CGT asset is acquired is important for 5 reasons:\n\n\n\u2022CGT generally does not apply to assets acquired before 20 September 1985 (pre-CGT assets)\n\u2022different cost base rules apply to assets acquired at different times \u2013 for example, the costs of owning an asset (see\n[Third element: costs of owning the asset](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATTHIRDELEMENTCOSTSOFOWNINGTHEASSET%22&PiT=99991231235958#THIRDELEMENTCOSTSOFOWNINGTHEASSET)\n) are not included in the cost base if you acquired it before 21 August 1991\n\u2022it determines whether the cost base can be indexed for inflation and the extent of that indexation, see\n[How to work out your capital gain or capital loss](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATHOWTOWORKOUTYOURCAPITALGAINORCAPITALLOSS%22&PiT=99991231235958#HOWTOWORKOUTYOURCAPITALGAINORCAPITALLOSS)\n\u2022it determines whether you are eligible for the CGT discount \u2013 for example, one requirement is that you need to have owned the CGT asset for at least 12 months, see\n[How to work out your capital gain or capital loss](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATHOWTOWORKOUTYOURCAPITALGAINORCAPITALLOSS%22&PiT=99991231235958#HOWTOWORKOUTYOURCAPITALGAINORCAPITALLOSS)\n\u2022it determines whether you are eligible for modified CGT treatment \u2013 for example, a capital gain on eligible shares in an ESIC is disregarded if the shares were held continuously for at least 12 months but less than 10 years, see\n[Exemptions and rollovers](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATEXEMPTIONSANDROLLOVERS1%22&PiT=99991231235958#EXEMPTIONSANDROLLOVERS1)\n.\n\n\n\n\n**Compensation**\n\nThere can be CGT consequences when you receive compensation.\n\nYou disregard some capital gains made as a result of you receiving compensation, for example, compensation for personal injury or compensation payable under certain government programs. For details of other compensation you disregard, see\n[Exemptions](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATEXEMPTIONS%22&PiT=99991231235958#EXEMPTIONS)\n. You may defer a capital gain made as a result of compensation for the\n[loss, destruction or compulsory acquisition of an asset](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATLOSSDESTRUCTIONORCOMPULSORYACQUISITIONOFANASSET2%22&PiT=99991231235958#LOSSDESTRUCTIONORCOMPULSORYACQUISITIONOFANASSET2)\n.\n\nA compensation payment may relate to the disposal of, or permanent damage to, an underlying asset. The underlying asset is the most relevant asset to which the compensation amount is most directly related. For example, if you receive compensation for damage to a rental property, the most relevant asset (the underlying asset) is the rental property.\n\n\n\u2022If the payment relates to the disposal (in whole or part) of an underlying asset, the compensation is treated as additional capital proceeds for the disposal of that asset.\n\u2022If the payment relates to permanent damage to, or permanent reduction in the value of, an underlying asset, the compensation is treated as a recoupment of all or part of the acquisition cost of the asset (that is, you reduce the cost base and reduced cost base by the amount of the compensation).\n\u2022If the payment is not for an underlying asset, it relates to the disposal of the right to seek compensation. The capital gain or capital loss will be the difference between the incidental costs and the compensation received.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, see Taxation Ruling\n[TR 95/35](/law/view/document?LocID=%22TXR%2FTR9535%2FNAT%2FATO%22&PiT=99991231235958#ATO)\n*Income tax: capital gains: treatment of compensation receipts.*\n\n**Foreign residents, temporary residents and changing residency**\n\nThere are special CGT rules that apply if you are a foreign resident or if you become or stop being an Australian resident. Unless otherwise specified, 'Australian resident' means a resident of Australia for tax purposes. There are also specific rules for temporary residents. These rules don't affect pre-CGT assets.\n\nFor periods when you are a foreign resident or temporary resident only certain assets are subject to CGT. When you become an Australian resident or stop being one, the range of assets on which you pay CGT in Australia changes.\n\nYou may no longer receive the full 50% discount on capital gains made on taxable Australian property if you are an individual, a beneficiary of a trust, or a partner in a partnership and either:\n\n\n\u2022a foreign or temporary resident\n\u2022an Australian resident with a period of foreign residency.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, see\n[CGT discount for foreign residents](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Capital-gains-tax/Foreign-residents-and-capital-gains-tax/CGT-discount-for-foreign-residents/)\n.\n\n***Foreign residents***\n\nIf you are a foreign resident, you are subject to CGT if a CGT event happens to a CGT asset that is 'taxable Australian property'.\n\nThere are specific rules where the CGT asset is a share or right acquired under an employee share scheme and you are or have been a temporary resident.\n\nFor more information, see\n[ESS \u2013 Foreign income exemption for Australian residents and temporary residents](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/corporate-tax-measures-and-assurance/employee-share-schemes/in-detail/ess-foreign-income-exemption-for-australian-residents-and-temporary-residents)\n.\n\n***Taxable Australian property***\n\nTaxable Australian property includes:\n\n\n\u2022a direct interest in real property situated in Australia or a mining, prospecting or quarrying right to minerals, petroleum and quarry materials situated in Australia\n\u2022a CGT asset that you have used at any time in carrying on a business through a permanent establishment in Australia\n\u2022an indirect Australian real property interest (which is an interest in an entity, including a foreign entity, where you and your associates hold 10% or more of the entity and the value of your interest is principally attributable to Australian real property).\n\n\n\n\nTaxable Australian property also includes an option or right over one of the above.\n\nFor CGT events happening on or after 20 May 2009, a leasehold interest in land situated in Australia is 'real property situated in Australia'.\n\nCertain CGT assets will also be taken to be taxable Australian property. See\n[Choosing to disregard capital gains and capital losses when you cease being an Australian resident](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCHOOSINGTODISREGARDCAPITALGAINSANDCAPITALLOSSES%22&PiT=99991231235958#CHOOSINGTODISREGARDCAPITALGAINSANDCAPITALLOSSES)\n.\n\nIf you are a foreign resident, or the trustee of a trust that was not a resident trust for CGT purposes, and:\n\n\n\u2022you acquired a post-CGT indirect Australian real property interest before 11 May 2005; and\n\u2022that interest did not have the necessary connection with Australia but is taxable Australian property.\n\n\n\n\nYou are taken to have acquired it on 10 May 2005 for its market value on that day.\n\nIf you are a foreign resident and have entered into a transaction on or after 1 July 2016 to dispose of a CGT asset of yours that is taxable Australian property, payments made to you in that transaction may be subject to withholding.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Foreign residents and capital gains tax](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/capital-gains-tax/foreign-residents-and-capital-gains-tax)\n.\n\n***Temporary residents***\n\nTemporary residents are subject to the same CGT rules as foreign residents. However, there are specific rules where the CGT asset is a share or right acquired under an employee share scheme and you are, or have been, a temporary resident. For more information, see\n[ESS \u2013 Foreign income exemption for Australian residents and temporary residents](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/corporate-tax-measures-and-assurance/employee-share-schemes/in-detail/ess-foreign-income-exemption-for-australian-residents-and-temporary-residents)\n.\n\nThis means, if you are a temporary resident, you will be subject to CGT on CGT events that happen to taxable Australian property.\n\nYou are a temporary resident if you:\n\n\n\u2022hold a temporary visa granted under the\n*Migration Act 1958*\n\u2022are not an Australian resident within the meaning of the\n*Social Security Act 1991,*\nand\n\u2022don't have a spouse who is an Australian resident within the meaning of the\n*Social Security Act 1991.*\n\n\n\n\nThe\n*Social Security Act 1991*\ndefines an Australian resident as a person who resides in Australia and is an Australian citizen, the holder of a permanent visa, or a protected special category visa holder.\n\nAnyone who is an Australian resident for tax purposes after 6 April 2006, but is not a temporary resident, can't later become a temporary resident, even if they later hold a temporary visa.\n\n***Ceasing to be a temporary resident***\n\nIf you cease being a temporary resident and remain an Australian resident, then you are taken to have acquired assets (other than assets you acquired before 20 September 1985) that are not taxable Australian property for their market value at the time you ceased being a temporary resident. There is an exception to this rule for employee shares and rights.\n\n***Becoming a resident***\n\nWhen you become an Australian resident (other than a temporary resident), you are taken to have acquired certain assets at the time you became a resident, for their market value at that time.\n\nThis doesn't apply to assets you acquired before 20 September 1985 (pre-CGT assets) and assets that were taxable Australian property.\n\nIf you have become a resident, the general cost base rules apply to any CGT assets that are taxable Australian property.\n\n***Ceasing to be an Australian resident***\n\nIf you cease being an Australian resident, or ceased being a resident trust for CGT purposes, you are taken to have disposed of each of your assets that are not taxable Australian property for their market value at the time you ceased being a resident. In the case of any indirect Australian real property interests and options or rights to acquire such interests, you are taken to have immediately reacquired these assets for their market value.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Taxable Australian property](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATTAXABLEAUSTRALIANPROPERTY%22&PiT=99991231235958#TAXABLEAUSTRALIANPROPERTY)\n.\n\n*Exemption for a temporary resident*\n\nIf you are a\n[temporary resident](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATTEMPORARYRESIDENTS%22&PiT=99991231235958#TEMPORARYRESIDENTS)\nwhen you cease to be an Australian resident, you are not taken to have disposed of any of your assets.\n\n*Choosing to disregard capital gains and capital losses*\n\nIf you are an individual, you can choose to disregard all capital gains and capital losses you made when you stopped being a resident.\n\nIf you ceased being a resident and make this choice, the assets are taken to be taxable Australian property until the earlier of either:\n\n\n\u2022a CGT event happening to the assets that involves you ceasing to own the assets (for example, their sale or disposal)\n\u2022you again becoming an Australian resident.\n\n\n\n\nThe effect of making this choice is that the increase or decrease in value of the assets from the time you cease being a resident to the time of the next CGT event, or of you again becoming a resident, is also taken into account in working out your capital gains or capital losses on those assets.\n\n**Choices**\n\nThere are a number of provisions in the CGT laws that allow you to make a choice.\n\nSome of the provisions allow you to defer or roll over a capital gain you make when a CGT event happens (such as exchanging an asset for a replacement asset) until a later CGT event (such as selling the replacement asset).\n\n***When and how you make a choice***\n\nThe general rule under CGT law is that you must make a choice by the day you lodge your income tax return for the income year in which the relevant CGT event happened.\n\nThe way you prepare your tax return is sufficient evidence of your choice. However, there are some exceptions:\n\n\n\u2022companies must make some decisions about replacement asset rollovers earlier\n\u2022choices relating to amounts disregarded under the small business retirement exemption must be made in writing\n\u2022choices relating to the assessment of capital gains of resident testamentary trusts must be made by a trustee within a specific period.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you make such a choice, it can't be changed. Your choice is binding.\n\nHowever, there are some circumstances when we consider that you have not made a choice. These are if you lodge your tax return without being aware that:\n\n\n\u2022events have happened that required you to make a choice, or\n\u2022a choice was available.\n\n\n\n\nIn these circumstances, we may allow you more time to make a choice.\n\n***Factors to be considered for an extension of time***\n\nTo determine if more time should be allowed, we consider factors such as whether:\n\n\n\u2022you have an acceptable explanation for not making the choice by the time it should have been made\n\u2022it would be fair and equitable in the circumstances to allow you more time to make a choice\n\u2022prejudice to the Commissioner of Taxation (Commissioner) may result from additional time being allowed to you (note that the absence of prejudice by itself is not enough to justify the granting of an extension)\n\u2022it would be fair and equitable to people in similar positions and the wider public interest\n\u2022any mischief is involved.\n\n\n\n\nEach case is decided on its own merits.\n\n***How to request an extension of time to make a choice***\n\nIf you have lodged a tax return without knowing a choice was available to you under CGT law and you want to find out how to make a request for more time to make the choice, see\n[Applying for an extension on a capital gain rollover](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/capital-gains-tax/cgt-events/applying-for-an-extension-on-a-capital-gain-rollover)\n.\n\n***Examples of choices available under capital gains tax***\n\nCGT choices you can make include:\n\n\n\u2022You may use the indexation method rather than the CGT discount method if a CGT event happens to a CGT asset you acquired before 21 September 1999 (or are taken to have acquired before that date for the purpose of using those methods). See\n[Choosing the indexation or discount method](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCHOOSINGTHEINDEXATIONORDISCOUNTMETHOD%22&PiT=99991231235958#CHOOSINGTHEINDEXATIONORDISCOUNTMETHOD)\n.\n\u2022You may make a capital loss for the income year in which a liquidator or administrator declares in writing that shares or securities held in a company are worthless.

This is known as a scrip for scrip rollover. It can also apply if a trust or fund in which you hold units is taken over and you receive units in the takeover trust or fund.

However, CGT event K6 can result in capital gains if certain CGT events happen to pre-CGT shares in a company or to pre-CGT interests in a trust. See Taxation Ruling\n[TR 2004/18](/law/view/document?LocID=%22TXR%2FTR200418%2FNAT%2FATO%22&PiT=99991231235958#ATO)\n*Income tax: capital gains: application of CGT event K6 (about pre-CGT shares and pre-CGT trust interests) in section 104-230 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.*\n\nAnother important exemption is for a capital gain or capital loss you make from a CGT event relating to a dwelling that was your main residence. This rule can change depending on how you came to own the dwelling and what you have done with it, for example, if you rented it out.

capital gains***\n\nYou may reduce your capital gain if, because of a CGT event, you have included an amount in your assessable income other than as a capital gain. For example, if you make a profit on the sale of land that is included in your assessable income as ordinary income, you don't also include that profit as a capital gain.\n\nThere is a range of concessions that allow you to disregard part or all of a capital gain made from an active asset you use in your small business.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Small business CGT concessions](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/income-deductions-and-concessions/income-and-deductions-for-business/concessions-offsets-and-rebates/small-business-cgt-concessions/small-business-cgt-concessions-eligibility-conditions/cgt-concessions-eligibility-overview)\n.\n\n***Other exemptions: capital losses***\n\nYou disregard any capital loss you make:\n\n\n\u2022from the expiry, forfeiture, surrender or assignment of a lease if the lease is not used solely or mainly for the purpose of producing assessable income\n\u2022from a payment to any entity of personal services income that is included in an individual's assessable income under the alienation of personal services income provisions, or any other amount attributable to that income\n\u2022as an exempt entity.\n\n\n\n\n***Other exemptions: Norfolk Island residents***\n\nThere are special rules for when CGT will apply to assets held by Norfolk Island residents. The references in this guide to 20 September 1985 apply in relation to the asset as if they were references to 24 October 2015, if:\n\n\n\u2022on or before 23 October 2015 you\n\n\n-were a Norfolk Island resident\n-acquired and held the CGT asset, and\n\n\n\n\u2022any capital gain or loss from a CGT event in relation to the asset would have been disregarded (because you were a Norfolk Island resident) if the CGT event in relation to the asset had instead happened immediately before 24 October 2015.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, see\n[Norfolk Island tax and super](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/capital-gains-tax/list-of-cgt-assets-and-exemptions)\n.\n\n***Other exemptions: granny flat arrangements***\n\nFrom 1 July 2021, no CGT event arises to eligible individuals on certain granny flat arrangements if the arrangement satisfies the requirements of the provisions. The CGT exemption will apply to the creation, variation or termination of a granny flat arrangement.\n\nThere are requirements that need to be satisfied for the CGT event not to happen:\n\n\n\u2022The individual is eligible for the granny flat interest if they have reached\n[pension age](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/age-pension/who-can-get-it)\nor have a disability that means they require assistance for most day-to-day activities for at least 12 months.\n\u2022An individual owns the dwelling where the granny flat interest is held, or is to be held, at the time of entering into or varying the arrangement, or agrees to acquire such a dwelling under the arrangement.\n\u2022Both the individual who is to hold the granny flat interest, and the individual who owns or agrees to acquire the dwelling where the granny flat interest is to be held, are parties to the arrangement.\n\u2022The arrangement is in writing and indicates an intention for the parties to be legally bound by it.\n\u2022The arrangement is not of a commercial nature.\n\n\n\n\n*Granny flat interest*\n\nA 'granny flat interest' in a dwelling is a right (put in place under a granny flat arrangement) to occupy that dwelling for life.\n\nA granny flat interest does not have to relate to properties often referred to as 'granny flats' as it is not a description of the type of property. An individual can have a granny flat interest in a wide range of properties, such as a family home, or a family's rental property or holiday home.\n\nThe property that an individual has the right to occupy for life will not change its CGT status as a result of the granny flat arrangement. For example, if the property is eligible for the main residence exemption, the granny flat arrangement will not change this. If the property is not eligible for the main residence exemption, a granny flat arrangement will not make it eligible. This is because the asset arising from the granny flat arrangement is the right to occupy a property, not the property itself.\n\n*Dwelling*\n\nUnder this measure, the term refers to the dwelling the individual has the right to occupy because of the granny flat interest.\n\n'Dwelling' is a unit of accommodation, such as a residential home, and includes the land beneath the home.\n\nFor more information see\n[Granny flat arrangements and CGT](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/capital-gains-tax/property-and-capital-gains-tax/granny-flat-arrangements-and-cgt)\n.\n\n***Rollovers***\n\nYou may defer or disregard (that is, rollover) a capital gain or capital loss until a later CGT event happens. The types of rollovers available are listed below. Only the first 4 types are covered in detail in this guide. If you would like information on the others,\n[contact us](https://www.ato.gov.au/about-ato/contact-us/)\n.\n\n***Marriage or relationship breakdown***\n\nIn certain cases where an asset or a share of an asset is transferred from one spouse to another after their marriage or relationship breaks down, any CGT is automatically deferred until a later CGT event happens. For example, until the former spouse sells the asset to someone else. For more examples of how CGT obligations are affected by marriage or relationship breakdown, see\n[Marriage or relationship breakdown](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATMARRIAGEORRELATIONSHIPBREAKDOWN1%22&PiT=99991231235958#MARRIAGEORRELATIONSHIPBREAKDOWN1)\n.\n\n***Loss, destruction or compulsory acquisition of an asset***\n\nYou may defer a capital gain in some cases where a CGT asset has been lost, destroyed or is compulsorily acquired.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Loss, destruction or compulsory acquisition of an asset](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATLOSSDESTRUCTIONORCOMPULSORYACQUISITIONOFANASSET2%22&PiT=99991231235958#LOSSDESTRUCTIONORCOMPULSORYACQUISITIONOFANASSET2)\n.\n\n***Scrip for scrip***\n\nYou may be able to defer a capital gain if you dispose of your shares in a company or interest in a trust as a result of a takeover, see\n[Scrip for scrip rollover](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATSCRIPFORSCRIPROLLOVER%22&PiT=99991231235958#SCRIPFORSCRIPROLLOVER)\n.\n\n***Demergers***\n\nYou may be able to defer a capital gain or capital loss if a CGT event happens to your shares in a company or interest in a trust as a result of a demerger, see\n[Demergers](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATDEMERGERS1%22&PiT=99991231235958#DEMERGERS1)\n.\n\n***Other replacement asset rollovers***\n\nYou may be able to defer a capital gain or capital loss when you replace an asset in the following circumstances:\n\n\n\u2022an individual or trustee disposes of assets to, or creates assets in, a wholly owned company\n\u2022partners dispose of assets to, or create assets in, a wholly owned company\n\u2022a CGT event happens to small business assets and you acquire replacement assets\n\u2022your statutory licence ends and is replaced with another statutory licence or licences which authorises substantially similar activity to the original licence or licences\n\u2022you are a financial service provider who had assets (for example, licences) replaced on transition to the financial services reform (FSR) regime\n\u2022your property is converted to strata title\n\u2022you exchange shares in the same company or units in the same unit trust\n\u2022you exchange rights or options to acquire shares in a company or units in a unit trust\n\u2022you exchange shares in one company for shares in an interposed company\n\u2022you exchange units in a unit trust for shares in a company\n\u2022a body is converted to an incorporated company\n\u2022you acquire a Crown lease\n\u2022you acquire a depreciating asset\n\u2022you acquire prospecting and mining entitlements\n\u2022you dispose of a security under a securities lending arrangement\n\u2022a trust restructure ends your ownership of units or interests\n\u2022a membership interest in a medical defence organisation (MDO) is replaced with a similar membership interest in another MDO and both MDOs are companies limited by guarantee\n\u2022you replace an entitlement to water with one or more different water entitlements.\n\n\n\n\nIf you would like information on these rollovers,\n[contact us](https://www.ato.gov.au/about-ato/contact-us/)\nor your recognised tax adviser.\n\n***Other same asset rollovers***\n\nYou may be able to defer a capital gain or capital loss when you transfer or dispose of assets in the following circumstances:\n\n\n\u2022an individual or trustee transfers a CGT asset to a wholly owned company\n\u2022a partner transfers their interest in a CGT asset to a wholly owned company\n\u2022a CGT asset is transferred between related companies\n\u2022a trust disposes of a CGT asset to a company under a trust restructure\n\u2022a CGT event happens because of a change to a trust deed of a complying approved deposit fund, a complying superannuation fund or a fund that accepts worker entitlement contributions\n\u2022a CGT asset is transferred from one small superannuation fund to another complying superannuation fund because of a marriage or relationship breakdown\n\u2022a trustee of a trust creates a trust over a CGT asset or transfers a CGT asset to another trust where both the transferring and receiving trusts meet certain requirements.\n\n\n\n\nIf you would like information on these rollovers,\n[contact us](https://www.ato.gov.au/about-ato/contact-us/)\nor your recognised tax adviser.\n\n**CGT and foreign exchange gains and losses**\n\nA CGT asset can be denominated in a foreign currency and foreign currency cash itself can be a CGT asset. Gains or losses that you make during the period that you hold such assets will generally be taxed as a capital gain or capital loss respectively. However, if dealings with foreign currency denominated assets give rise to rights to receive or obligations to pay foreign currency, the rights or obligations may be subject to the foreign exchange (forex) provisions when a right or obligation ceases. For example, if a contract you enter into to sell an overseas rental property is denominated in foreign currency, you will have a right to receive foreign currency (being the sale price of the rental property). The right ceases on payment of the foreign currency. Such rights and obligations will usually arise on the acquisition or disposal of a CGT asset.\n\nA forex gain or loss commonly arises for the acquisition or disposal of a CGT asset denominated in foreign currency, where there is a currency exchange rate fluctuation between the date you entered into the contract and the date of settlement of the contract (when payment occurs). Currency fluctuations between the date of acquisition and date of disposal of a CGT asset are taken into account when the cost base and capital proceeds are translated into Australian currency.\n\nIt may be that the gain or loss you make on the ending of rights for foreign currency, a disposal of foreign currency or a right to receive foreign currency is taxable under both CGT and the forex measures. Generally, to the extent that both the forex measures and CGT bring to account a forex gain or loss, the forex measures take precedence. That is the forex gain or loss is brought to account only under the forex provisions.\n\nIn addition, if the TOFA rules apply to you, your\n[foreign exchange gains and losses](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/corporate-tax-measures-and-assurance/taxation-of-financial-arrangements-tofa/in-detail/guide-to-the-taxation-of-financial-arrangements-tofa)\nmay be brought to account under those TOFA rules instead of the forex measures.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Guide to the taxation of financial arrangements (TOFA)](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/corporate-tax-measures-and-assurance/foreign-exchange-gains-and-losses/capital-assets-and-the-12-month-rule)\n.\n\n***Short-term foreign exchange gains and losses rules***\n\nSome short-term foreign exchange (forex) gains or losses will be treated as capital gains or capital losses. This arises under transactions for the acquisition or disposal of certain CGT assets. In such cases, CGT events K10 or K11 will happen, which will result in the forex gain or loss being integrated into the tax treatment of the CGT asset. Or they are matched to the character of the gain or loss that would arise from the disposal of the asset. For the short-term rules to apply, the due date for payment must be within 12 months of acquiring or disposing of the asset.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Capital assets and the 12-month rule](https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Foreign-exchange-gains-and-losses/Capital-assets-and-the-12-month-rule/)\n.\n\n***Translating (converting) CGT assets to Australian dollars***\n\nFor information on what exchange rates to use in translating foreign currency amounts into Australian currency, see\n[Translation (conversion) rules](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/corporate-tax-measures-and-assurance/foreign-exchange-gains-and-losses/translation-conversion-rules)\n.\n\n***Examples of the application of forex rules to CGT assets***\n\nFor examples of the application of the forex rules to acquisitions and disposals of foreign currency denominated CGT assets, see\n[Common forex transactions](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/corporate-tax-measures-and-assurance/foreign-exchange-gains-and-losses/common-forex-transactions)\n.\n\n**CGT and depreciating assets**\n\nUnder the uniform capital allowance (UCA) system, a capital gain or capital loss may arise from the disposal of a depreciating asset. It will only arise to the extent that you have used the asset for a non-taxable purpose (for example, for private purposes).\n\nYou calculate a capital gain or capital loss from a depreciating asset used for a non-taxable purpose using the UCA concepts of cost and termination value. You don't use the concepts of capital proceeds and cost base found in the CGT provisions.\n\nIf a balancing adjustment event occurs for a depreciating asset that you have at some time used for a non-taxable purpose, a CGT event happens. See\n[CGT event K7](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATTABLEOTHERCGTEVENTS%22&PiT=99991231235958#TABLEOTHERCGTEVENTS)\nin appendix 1. The most common balancing adjustment event for a depreciating asset occurs when you stop holding it (for example, you sell, lose or destroy it) or stop using it.\n\n***Calculating a capital gain or loss for a depreciating asset***\n\nYou make a capital gain if the termination value of your depreciating asset is greater than its cost. You make a capital loss if the reverse is the case, that is, the asset's cost is more than its termination value.\n\nYou use different formulas to calculate a capital gain or capital loss depending on whether the asset is in a low-value pool or not.\n\n***Depreciating asset not in a low-value pool: capital gain***\n\nIf your depreciating asset is not a pooled asset, you calculate the capital gain as follows:\n\n`(termination value - cost) \u00d7 (total of reductions note 1 \u00f7 total decline note 2)`\n\n\n\n***Depreciating asset not in a low-value pool: capital loss***\n\nYou calculate the capital loss from a depreciating asset that is not a pooled asset as follows:\n\n`(cost - termination value) \u00d7 (total of reductions (note 1 \u00f7 total decline note 2)`\n\n**Example 8: capital gain on depreciating asset**\n> Larry purchased a truck in August 2022 for $25,000 and sold it in June 2024 for $27,000. He used the truck 10% of the time for private purposes. The decline in value of the truck under the UCA system up to the date of sale was $2,000. Therefore, the total of his reductions relating to his private use is $200 (10% of $2,000). Larry calculates his capital gain from CGT event K7 as follows:\n> \n> `($27,000 - $25,000) \u00d7 (200 \u00f7 2,000)`\n\n> Capital gain from CGT event K7 = $200 (before applying any discount).\n\n\n\n\n\n***Depreciating asset in a low-value pool: capital gain***\n\nYou calculate the capital gain from a depreciating asset in a low-value pool as follows:\n\n`(termination value - cost) \u00d7 (1 - taxable use fraction (note 3))`\n\n\n\n***Depreciating asset in a low-value pool: capital loss***\n\nYou calculate the capital loss from a depreciating asset in a low-value pool as follows:\n\n`(cost - termination value) \u00d7 (1 - taxable use fraction (note 3))`\n\n\n\n**Notes**\n\n\n1.The\n**total of the reductions**\nin your deductions for the asset's decline in value that is attributable to\n\n\n-your use of the asset, or\n-having it installed ready for use, for a non-taxable purpose.\n\n\n\n2.The\n**decline in the value**\nof the depreciating asset since you started to hold it.\n3.\n**Taxable use fraction**\nis the percentage of the asset's use that is for producing your assessable income, expressed as a fraction. This is the percentage you reasonably estimate at the time you allocated the asset to the low-value pool.\n\n\n\n\n***Application of CGT concessions***\n\nA capital gain from a depreciating asset may qualify for the CGT discount if the relevant conditions are satisfied. If the CGT discount applies, there is no reduction of the capital gain under the indexation method.\n\nThe\n[small business CGT concessions](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/income-deductions-and-concessions/income-and-deductions-for-business/concessions-offsets-and-rebates/small-business-cgt-concessions/small-business-cgt-concessions-eligibility-conditions/cgt-concessions-eligibility-overview)\ndo not apply to a capital gain made from the disposal of a depreciating asset. This is because a capital gain can only arise out of such an asset's use for non-taxable purposes (for example, to the extent it is used for private purposes).\n\nFor more information, see\n[How to work out your capital gain or capital loss](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATHOWTOWORKOUTYOURCAPITALGAINORCAPITALLOSS%22&PiT=99991231235958#HOWTOWORKOUTYOURCAPITALGAINORCAPITALLOSS)\n.\n\n***Do any CGT exemptions apply to a depreciating asset?***\n\nExemptions may apply to a capital gain or capital loss made from the disposal of a depreciating asset:\n\n\n\u2022pre-CGT assets \u2013 you disregard a capital gain or capital loss from a depreciating asset if the asset was acquired before 20 September 1985\n\u2022personal use asset\n\n\n-if a depreciating asset is a personal use asset (that is, one used or kept mainly for personal use and enjoyment), you disregard any capital loss from CGT event K7\n-you also disregard a capital gain under CGT event K7 from a personal use asset costing $10,000 or less\n\n\n\n\u2022collectables \u2013 you disregard a capital gain or a capital loss from a depreciating asset that is a collectable costing $500 or less\n\u2022balancing adjustment event and CGT event \u2013 you only include a balancing adjustment event that gives rise to a capital gain or capital loss under CGT event K7. However, capital proceeds received under other CGT events (for example,\n[CGT event D1](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATTABLEBRINGINGACGTASSETINTOEXISTENCE%22&PiT=99991231235958#TABLEBRINGINGACGTASSETINTOEXISTENCE)\n) may still be relevant for a depreciating asset as CGT events are not the equivalent of balancing adjustment events.\n\n\n\n\n***Treatment of intellectual property***\n\nUnder the capital allowance rules, intellectual property is a depreciating asset.\n\nIf you grant or assign an interest in an item of intellectual property, you are treated as if you had stopped holding part of the item. You are also treated as if, just before you stop holding that part, you had split the original item of intellectual property into 2 parts. That is, the part you stopped holding and the rest of the original item. You determine a first element of the cost for each part.\n\nThis treatment applies if a licence is granted over an item of intellectual property. To this extent, the treatment of intellectual property is different from other depreciating assets. The granting of a licence in respect of other depreciating assets would result in CGT event D1 (about creating contractual rights) happening.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Guide to depreciating assets 2024](https://www.ato.gov.au/forms-and-instructions/depreciating-assets-guide-2024)\n.\n\n**Where to now?**\n\n[How to work out your capital gain or capital loss](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATHOWTOWORKOUTYOURCAPITALGAINORCAPITALLOSS%22&PiT=99991231235958#HOWTOWORKOUTYOURCAPITALGAINORCAPITALLOSS)\nexplains how to calculate a capital gain using one of the 3 methods:\n\n\n\u2022indexation\n\u2022discount\n\u2022'other'.\n\n\n\n\n[Trust distributions](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATTRUSTDISTRIBUTIONS%22&PiT=99991231235958#TRUSTDISTRIBUTIONS)\nin\n**part A**\nexplains how to calculate your capital gain if a managed fund or trust has distributed a capital gain to you.

They are explained in more detail in the following pages. In some cases, you may be able to choose either the discount method or the indexation method to calculate your capital gain. In these cases, you can use the method that gives you the better result.\n\nThe\n[CGT summary worksheet for 2024 tax returns](https://www.ato.gov.au/forms-and-instructions/capital-gains-tax-summary-worksheet-2024)\nshows the 3 methods of calculating a capital gain. You are not obliged to use this worksheet, but you may find it helps you calculate your capital gain or capital loss for each CGT event.\n\n\n\n\n*Table 2: Capital gain calculation methods*\n  \n\n| Method type | Indexation method | Discount method | 'other' method |\n| **Description of method** | Allows you to increase the cost base by applying an indexation factor based on CPI up to September 1999 | Allows you to discount your capital gain | Basic method of subtracting the cost base from the capital proceeds |\n| **When can you use the method** | For an asset owned for 12 months or more. Use only for assets acquired before 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999. | For an asset owned for 12 months or more | You must use when the indexation and discount methods don't apply (for example, if you have bought and sold an asset within 12 months). |\n| **How to calculate your capital gain using the method** | Apply the relevant indexation factor, see CPI table at [Appendix 2](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATA2%22&PiT=99991231235958#A2) , then subtract the indexed cost base from the capital proceeds, see worked example 13 . | Subtract the cost base from the capital proceeds, deduct any capital losses, then reduce by the relevant discount percentage, see worked example 13 . | Subtract the cost base (or the amount specified by the relevant CGT event) from the capital proceeds, see worked example 9 . |\n\n\n\n**The 'other' method**\n\nThis is the simplest of the 3 methods. You must use the 'other' method to calculate your capital gain if you have bought and sold your asset within 12 months or generally for CGT events that don't involve an asset. In these cases, the indexation and discount methods don't apply.\n\nGenerally, to use the 'other' method, you simply subtract your cost base (what the asset cost you) from your capital proceeds (how much you sold it for). The amount of proceeds left is your capital gain. For some types of CGT events, a cost base is not relevant. See\n[Appendix 1](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATA1%22&PiT=99991231235958#A1)\nfor the amounts to use.\n\n**Example 9: calculating a capital gain using the 'other' method**\n> Marie-Anne bought a property for $250,000 under a contract dated 23 June 2023. The contract provided for the payment of a deposit of $25,000 on that date, with the balance of $225,000 to be paid on settlement on 4 August 2023.\n\n> Marie-Anne paid stamp duty of $5,000 on 20 July 2023. On 4 August 2023, she received an account for solicitor's fees of $2,000 which she paid as part of the settlement process.\n\n> Marie-Anne sold the property on 16 October 2023 (the day the contracts were exchanged) for $315,000. She incurred costs of $1,500 in solicitor's fees and $4,000 in agent's commission.\n\n> As she bought and sold her property within 12 months, Marie-Anne must use the 'other' method to calculate her capital gain.\n\n> 1. The cost base is\n> **$262,500,**\n> made up of:\n> \n> \n> -purchase cost of $225,000 + deposit of $25,000 + $5,000 stamp duty\n> -solicitor's fees for purchase of property $2,000\n> -solicitor's fees for sale of property $1,500\n> -agent's commission $4,000.\n\n> 2. Marie-Anne works out her capital gain as follows:\n> \n> \n> -capital proceeds of $315,000\n> -*subtract*\n> cost base of $262,500: $315,000 - $262,500 = $52,500\n> -the capital gain calculated using the 'other' method is\n> **$52,500.**\n\n> Assuming Marie-Anne has not made any other capital losses or capital gains in 2023\u201324, and does not have any unapplied net capital losses from earlier years, the net capital gain to be included at question\n> **18**\n> in her\n> *Tax return for individuals (supplementary section) 2024*\n> is $52,500.\n\n\n\n\n\n**The indexation method**\n\nUse the indexation method to calculate your capital gain if:\n\n\n\u2022a CGT event happened to an asset you acquired before 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999\n\u2022you owned the asset for 12 months or more.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are not a company and you meet the 2 conditions above and you wish to use the indexation method, you must choose to do so, otherwise the discount method will apply. If you are a company (other than a listed investment company) and the capital gain meets the conditions listed above, you must use the indexation method to calculate the capital gain. Specific rules affect certain assets of a life insurance company.\n\nUnder the indexation method, you increase each amount included in an element of the cost base (other than those in the third element, costs of owning the asset) by an indexation factor.\n\nThe indexation factor is worked out using the consumer price index (CPI) at\n[Appendix 2](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATA2%22&PiT=99991231235958#A2)\n.\n\nIf the CGT event happened on or after 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999, you can only index the elements of your cost base up to 30 September 1999. You use this formula:\n\n`A = B \u00f7 C`\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\u2022A is the indexation factor\n\u2022B is CPI for the quarter ending September 1999 (68.7)\n\u2022C is CPI for the quarter in which expenditure was incurred\n\n\n\n\nIf the CGT event happened before 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999, you use this formula:\n\n`A = B \u00f7 C`\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\u2022A is the indexation factor\n\u2022B is CPI for the quarter when CGT event happened\n\u2022C is CPI for the quarter in which expenditure was incurred\n\n\n\n\nWork out the indexation factor to 3 decimal places, rounding up if the 4th decimal place is 5 or more.\n\nFor most assets, you index expenditure from the date you incur it, even if you don't pay some of the expenditure until a later time. However, there is an exception for partly paid shares or units acquired on or after 16 August 1989. If the company or trust later makes a call on the shares or units, you use the CPI for the quarter in which you made that later payment.\n\nThere are some exceptions to the requirement that you must have owned an asset for at least 12 months for indexation to apply. For example, you can use the indexation method if either:\n\n\n\u2022you acquire a CGT asset as a legal personal representative or a beneficiary of a deceased estate. The 12-month requirement is satisfied if the deceased acquired the asset 12 months or more before you disposed of it\n\u2022you acquired an asset as the result of a marriage or relationship breakdown. You will satisfy the 12-month requirement if the combined period your spouse and you owned the asset is more than 12 months.\n\n\n\n\n**The discount method**\n\nUse the discount method to calculate your capital gain if:\n\n\n\u2022you are an individual, a trust or a complying superannuation entity\n\u2022a CGT event happens to an asset you own\n\u2022the CGT event happened after 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999\n\u2022you acquired the asset at least 12 months before the CGT event\n\u2022you did not choose to use the indexation method.\n\n\n\n\nIn determining whether you acquired the CGT asset at least 12 months before the CGT event, you exclude both the day of acquisition and the day of the CGT event.\n\nYou can use the discount method to work out your capital gain from the property if you:\n\n\n\u2022acquire a property and construct a building or make improvements to it that are not separate assets, see\n[Separate assets](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATSEPARATEASSETS%22&PiT=99991231235958#SEPARATEASSETS)\n\u2022owned the property for at least 12 months (even if you did not construct the new building or improvements more than 12 months before the CGT event happened).\n\n\n**Example 10: discount method**\n> Sally acquired a CGT asset on 2 February 2023. She is entitled to apply the CGT discount if a CGT event happened to that asset on or after 3 February 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn certain circumstances, you may be eligible for the CGT discount even if you have not owned the asset for at least 12 months. For example:\n\n\n\u2022You acquire a CGT asset as a legal personal representative or as a beneficiary of a deceased estate. The 12-month requirement is satisfied if the asset was acquired by the deceased\n\n\n-before 20 September 1985 and you disposed of it 12 months or more after they died, or\n-on or after 20 September 1985 and you disposed of it 12 months or more after they acquired it.\n\n\n\n\u2022You acquired a CGT asset as the result of a\n[marriage or relationship breakdown](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATMARRIAGEORRELATIONSHIPBREAKDOWN1%22&PiT=99991231235958#MARRIAGEORRELATIONSHIPBREAKDOWN1)\nand rollover applies. You will satisfy the 12-month requirement if the combined period your spouse and you owned the asset was more than 12 months.\n\u2022A CGT asset was compulsorily acquired, lost or destroyed and you acquired a rollover replacement asset, you will satisfy the 12-month requirement for the replacement asset if the period of ownership of the original asset and the replacement asset was at least 12 months.\n\n\n\n\n***Certain capital gains are excluded***\n\nThe CGT discount does not apply to capital gains from certain CGT events. The CGT discount does not apply to these CGT events:\n\n\n\u2022D1 Creating contractual or other rights\n\u2022D2 Granting an option\n\u2022D3 Granting a right to income from mining\n\u2022E9 Creating a trust over future property\n\u2022F1 Granting a lease\n\u2022F2 Granting a long-term lease\n\u2022F5 Lessor receives payment for changing a lease\n\u2022H2 Receipt for an event relating to a CGT asset\n\u2022J2 Change for replacement asset or improved asset after a rollover under Subdivision 152-E\n\u2022J5 Failure to acquire replacement asset and to incur 4th element expenditure after a rollover under Subdivision 152-E\n\u2022J6 Cost of acquisition of replacement asset or amount of 4th element expenditure, or both, not sufficient to cover disregarded capital gain\n\u2022K10 Forex realisation gain.\n\n\n\n\nThe full list of CGT events is shown at\n[Appendix 1](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATA1%22&PiT=99991231235958#A1)\n.\n\nIf you make a capital gain from a CGT event that creates a new asset (for example, receiving a payment for agreeing not to do something; that is, entering into a restrictive covenant) you can't satisfy the 12-month ownership rule, so your CGT event does not qualify for the CGT discount.\n\nThe CGT discount may be denied:\n\n\n\u2022if the CGT event that gave rise to the capital gain occurred under an agreement that was made within 12 months of the acquisition of the asset\n\u2022on the disposal of certain shares or trust interests in non-widely held companies and trusts, that is, those with fewer than 300 members\n\u2022if an arrangement was entered into for the purposes of claiming the CGT discount under which an 'income' asset was converted into a 'capital' asset (conversion of income to capital) (Part IVA of the\n*Income Tax Assessment Act 1936).*\n\n\n\n\nIf the\n[home first used to produce income](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATHOMEFIRSTUSEDTOPRODUCEINCOME%22&PiT=99991231235958#HOMEFIRSTUSEDTOPRODUCEINCOME)\nrule applies and the period between when you first used the dwelling to produce income and the CGT event happening is not at least 12 months, the discount method is not available.\n\n***Discount percentage***\n\nThe discount percentage is the percentage by which you reduce your capital gain. You can reduce the capital gain only after you have applied all the capital losses for 2023\u201324 and any unapplied net capital losses from earlier years.\n\nThe discount percentage is 50% for individuals and trusts.\n\nYou may no longer receive the full 50% discount on capital gains made on taxable Australian property if you are an individual, a beneficiary of a trust, or a partner in a partnership and you are either:\n\n\n\u2022a foreign or temporary resident\n\u2022an Australian resident with a period of foreign residency.\n\n\n\n\nAn additional\n[CGT discount](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/capital-gains-tax/property-and-capital-gains-tax/cgt-discount-for-affordable-housing)\nof up to 10% may be available to Australian resident individuals who provide affordable rental housing to people earning low to moderate income. This increases the CGT discount percentage to up to 60% for qualifying owners of these residential rental properties. To qualify, you must have provided affordable housing:\n\n\n\u2022on or after 1 January 2018 for a period or periods totalling at least 3 years (1,095 days), which may be aggregate usage over different periods; and\n\u2022either directly, or from a trust including where there is an interposed entity between you and the trust. The trust that provides the affordable housing and any interposed entities may be a trust, a managed investment trust or partnership, but can't be a public unit trust or superannuation fund.\n\n\n\n\nThe number of days you may have provided affordable housing before 1 January 2018 will not be counted.\n\nFor more information, see\n[CGT discount for foreign residents](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/capital-gains-tax/foreign-residents-and-capital-gains-tax/cgt-discount-for-foreign-residents)\n.\n\n**Choosing the indexation or discount method**\n\nFor assets you acquired before 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999 and have held for 12 months or more, you can choose to use the indexation method or the discount method to calculate your capital gain.\n\nThere is no one factor to use as a basis to select the better option as it depends on:\n\n\n\u2022the type of asset you own\n\u2022how long you have owned it\n\u2022the dates you owned it\n\u2022past rates of inflation.\n\n\n\n\nBecause capital losses must be offset against capital gains before the discount is applied, your choice may also depend on the amount of capital losses that you have available.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Choices](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCHOICES%22&PiT=99991231235958#CHOICES)\n.\n\n**Example 11: comparison of discount and indexation methods**\n> Justin sold some land and has a $10,000 capital gain under the discount method (before applying the CGT discount) or a $7,000 capital gain under the indexation method. If Justin has no capital losses, the discount method will produce the smaller capital gain (that is, $5,000).\n\n> However, Justin also made a capital loss of $5,000 on the sale of some shares. He will be better off using the indexation method to work out the capital gain from the sale of his land. Under this method, his net capital gain is $2,000 (that is, $7,000 subtract $5,000). If he used the discount method, his net capital gain would be $2,500 (that is $10,000 subtract $5,000, multiplied by 50%).\n\n\n\n\n\n**Example 12**\nshows that applying one method to work out your capital gains on a whole parcel of shares you acquired before September 1999 may not be to your advantage if you have capital losses or net capital losses to apply.\n\nIn this situation, you will get a better result if you apply the indexation method to sufficient shares to absorb the capital loss (or as much of the capital loss as you can) and apply the discount method to any remaining shares.\n\n**Example 12: capital gains on shares where you also have capital losses**\n> Clare sold a parcel of 500 shares in March 2024 for $12,500, that is, for $25 each. She had acquired the shares in March 1995 for $7,500, that is, for $15 each, including stamp duty and brokerage. There was no brokerage on the sale. Clare had no other capital gains or capital losses in 2023\u201324, although she has $3,500 net capital losses carried forward from previous income years.\n\n> Because Clare owned the shares for more than 12 months she can use the discount method or the indexation method to work out her capital gains, whichever gives her a better result. Clare decides to work out her net capital gain by applying both the discount method and the indexation method to the whole parcel of shares:\n> \n> \n> *Comparison of indexation and discount methods*\n>   \n> \n> | Calculation element | Using indexation method  $ | Using discount method  $ |\n> | Capital proceeds | 12,500 | 12,500 |\n> | Cost base | 8,077 (see note 1  )  (acquisition cost \u00d7 indexation factor) | 7,500 |\n> | Capital gain | 4,423 | 5,000 |\n> | *subtract* capital losses | 3,500 | 3,500 |\n> | Subtotal | 923 | 1,500 |\n> | CGT discount | Nil | 750 |\n> | Net capital gain | 923 | 750 |\n\n> **Note 1:**\n> $7,500 \u00d7 1.077 (indexation factor is 68.7 \u00f7 63.8 = 1.077)\n\n> However, because each share is a separate asset, Clare can use different methods to work out her capital gains for shares within the parcel. The lowest net capital gain would result from her applying the indexation method to the sale of 395 (see note 2 below) shares, and the discount method to the remaining 105 shares. She works out her net capital gain as follows:\n\n> 1. Indexation method (395 shares), calculated as follows:\n> \n> \n> -capital proceeds ($25 each) are $9,875\n> -cost base (395 \u00d7 $15 \u00d7 1.077 each) is $6,381\n> -capital gain is $3,494 ($9,875 - $6,381 = $3,494)\n> -*subtract*\n> capital losses of $3,500\n> -capital gain/(loss) is -$6.\n\n> 2. Discount method (105 shares), calculated as follows:\n> \n> \n> -capital proceeds ($25 each) are $2,625\n> -cost base (105 \u00d7 $15) is $1,575:\n> -capital gain is $1,050 ($2,625 - $1,575 = $1,050)\n> -*subtract*\n> any remaining capital losses of $6 ($1,050 - $6 = $1,044)\n> -*subtract*\n> the CGT discount of $522\n> -the Net capital gain is $522.\n\n> **Note 2:**\n> To calculate this, Clare worked out the capital gain made on each share using the indexation method ($4,423 \u00f7 500 = 8.85) and divided the capital loss by this amount ($3,500 \u00f7 8.85 = 395).\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can choose to calculate your capital gain using both methods to find out which gives you the better result.

He sold it for $90,000 in November 2023. During the period he owned it, he was allowed capital works deductions of $7,500. Antonio works out his capital loss as follows.\n\n> 1.

He incurred brokerage and stamp duty of $100. In December 2023, Chandra sold all 800 shares for $2.50 per share. He incurred brokerage of $75. He made a capital loss, calculated as follows.\n\n> 1.

In these cases, see\n[Appendix 1](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATA1%22&PiT=99991231235958#A1)\nfor the amounts to use for the particular CGT event.\n\n***Reduced cost base***\n\nYou can't index a reduced cost base.\n\n### Keeping CGT records\n\nKeeping adequate records of all expenditure will help you correctly work out the amount of capital gain or capital loss you have made when a CGT event happens. It will also help to make sure you do not pay more CGT than is necessary.\n\n**On this page**\n\n\n\u2022[What records do you need to keep?](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATWHATRECORDSDOYOUNEEDTOKEEP%22&PiT=99991231235958#WHATRECORDSDOYOUNEEDTOKEEP)\n\u2022[Asset registers](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATASSETREGISTERS%22&PiT=99991231235958#ASSETREGISTERS)\n\u2022[Exceptions](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATEXCEPTIONS%22&PiT=99991231235958#EXCEPTIONS)\n\u2022[It is never too late to keep records](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATITISNEVERTOOLATETOKEEPRECORDS%22&PiT=99991231235958#ITISNEVERTOOLATETOKEEPRECORDS)\n\n\n\n\nYou must keep records of everything that affects your capital gains and capital losses. Penalties can apply if you don't keep the records for at least 5 years after the relevant CGT event. If you use information from those records in a later tax return, you may have to keep records for longer. If you have applied a net capital loss, you should generally keep your records of the CGT event that resulted in the loss until the end of any period of review for the income year in which the net capital loss is fully applied.\n\nKeeping good records can help your beneficiaries reduce the impact of CGT after you die. If you leave an asset to another person, the asset may be subject to CGT when a CGT event happens to that asset in the future, for example, if your daughter (the beneficiary) sells the shares (the asset) you have left her in your will.\n\nFor more information, see Taxation Determination\n[TD 2007/2](/law/view/document?LocID=%22TXD%2FTD20072%2FNAT%2FATO%22&PiT=99991231235958#ATO)\n*Income tax: should a taxpayer who has incurred a tax loss or made a net capital loss for an income year retain records relevant to the ascertainment of that loss only for the record retention period prescribed under income tax law?*\n\n**What records do you need to keep?**\n\nYou must keep records of every act, transaction, event or circumstance that may be relevant to working out whether you have made a capital gain or capital loss from a CGT event. It does not matter whether the CGT event has already happened or whether it may happen.\n\nThe records must be in English (or be readily accessible or translatable into English) and must show:\n\n\n\u2022the nature of the act, transaction, event or circumstance\n\u2022the day it happened\n\u2022who did the act or who were the parties to the transaction\n\u2022how the act, transaction, event or circumstance is relevant to working out the capital gain or capital loss.\n\n\n\n\nThe following are examples of records you may need to keep:\n\n\n\u2022receipts of purchase or transfer\n\u2022details of interest on money you borrowed relating to this asset\n\u2022records of agent, accountant, legal and advertising costs\n\u2022receipts for insurance costs, rates and land taxes\n\u2022any market valuations\n\u2022receipts for the cost of maintenance, repairs and modifications\n\u2022accounts showing brokerage on shares.\n\n\n\n\nYou should also keep records to establish whether you have claimed an income tax deduction for an item of expenditure. In many cases, if you have claimed a deduction for an amount, the expenditure may not be included in the cost base or reduced cost base of a CGT asset.\n\n***Records relating to real estate***\n\nReal estate can include the family home, vacant blocks of land, business premises, rental properties, holiday houses and hobby farms.\n\nEven though your family home is usually exempt, if you acquired it on or after 20 September 1985, try to keep all records relating to the home, just as you would for other items of real estate. If the home ceases to be fully exempt at some time in the future, you will need to know the full cost of the home so that you don't pay more CGT than necessary. If you don't have sufficient records, reconstructing them later could be difficult. For details of when your home may not be fully exempt, see\n[Real estate and main residence](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATREALESTATEANDMAINRESIDENCE%22&PiT=99991231235958#REALESTATEANDMAINRESIDENCE)\n.\n\nKeep a copy of the purchase contract and all receipts for expenses relating to the purchase of the property such as:\n\n\n\u2022stamp duty\n\u2022legal fees\n\u2022survey costs\n\u2022valuation fees.\n\n\n\n\nAlso keep all records relating to the CGT event and all relevant expenses, for example, the sale contract and records of legal fees and stamp duty.\n\nKeep a record of the following that you incurred during your period of ownership:\n\n\n\u2022capital expenditure on improvements\n\u2022costs of owning the property\n\u2022capital expenditure on maintaining title or right to it\n\n\n\n\nThese costs may form part of the cost base in working out whether you have made a capital gain or capital loss at the time the CGT event happens.\n\nCapital expenditure on improvements may include building an extension, addition or improvement, including initial repairs.\n\nExamples of costs of owning real estate include interest, rates and land taxes, insurance premiums and cost of repairs or replacing broken items. You only include such costs if you acquired the CGT asset on or after 21 August 1991 and if you have not claimed, and can't claim, a tax deduction for them.\n\nIf the property is your home and you use it to produce income (for example, by renting out part or all of it), you will need to keep records of the period the home is producing income and the proportion of the home you have used to produce income.\n\nIf, after 20 August 1996, you use your home for income-producing purposes for the first time, you will be taken to have acquired your home at that time for its market value. You will use this as your acquisition cost for the purpose of calculating a capital gain or capital loss at the time the CGT event happens. You will still need to keep details of expenses relating to your home after the date that it started producing income.\n\nSee\n[Marriage or relationship breakdown](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATMARRIAGEORRELATIONSHIPBREAKDOWN1%22&PiT=99991231235958#MARRIAGEORRELATIONSHIPBREAKDOWN1)\nabout records you may need to obtain from your spouse if your marriage or relationship has broken down and a CGT rollover applies on the transfer of real estate.\n\n***Records relating to shares in companies and units in unit trusts***\n\nMost of the records you need to keep regarding your disposal of shares in companies or units in unit trusts (including managed funds), will be given to you by the company, the unit trust manager or your stockbroker. It is important for you to keep everything they give you on your shares and units.\n\nThese records will generally provide the following important information:\n\n\n\u2022the date of purchase of the shares or units\n\u2022the amount paid to purchase the shares or units\n\u2022details of any non-assessable payments made to you during the time you owned the shares or units\n\u2022the date and amount of any calls if shares were partly paid\n\u2022the sale price if you sell them\n\u2022any commissions paid to brokers when you buy or sell them.\n\n\n\n\nThere are special CGT rules for certain shares and units, which may affect the records you keep. For example, bonus shares and units, rights and options, employee shares and eligible shares in an ESIC.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Investments in shares and units](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATINVESTMENTSINSHARESANDUNITS%22&PiT=99991231235958#INVESTMENTSINSHARESANDUNITS)\n.\n\n***Records relating to bonus shares***\n\nTo be safe, if you have received any bonus shares on or after 20 September 1985, keep all the documents the company gives you.\n\nFor any bonus shares issued before 1 July 1987, you need to know when the original shares were acquired. If you acquired them on or after 20 September 1985, you will also need to know what they cost.\n[Flowchart 3.1](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATFLOWCHART3.1%22&PiT=99991231235958#FLOWCHART3.1)\nin\n**appendix 3**\nsummarises the different rules applying to the treatment of bonus shares.\n\nKeep a record of any amounts you paid to acquire the bonus shares and any amounts taxed as a dividend when they were issued.\n\n***Records relating to shares in an ESIC***\n\nIf you invested in an ESIC, you may be entitled to the early stage investor tax incentives, including the modified CGT treatment for your shares. You should keep records to:\n\n\n\u2022support your entitlement to the incentives, for example, that you are an eligible investor and the company qualifies as an ESIC at the relevant test time\n\u2022show when you acquired the shares and, if disposed of within 12 months or after 10 years, how you have calculated your capital gain or capital loss\n\u2022support the market value of the shares if you have continuously held them for 10 years\n\u2022support your claim in respect of the modified CGT treatment and CGT rollovers in relation to eligible shares.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, see\n[Shares in an early stage innovation company](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATSHARESINANEARLYSTAGEINNOVATIONCOMPANY%22&PiT=99991231235958#SHARESINANEARLYSTAGEINNOVATIONCOMPANY)\n.\n\n***Records relating to inheriting an asset***\n\nIf you inherited an asset as a beneficiary of the estate of a person who died on or after 20 September 1985, you may need to obtain information from the executor or trustee.\n\nIf the deceased person acquired the asset before 20 September 1985, or an asset passes to you as the trustee of a Special Disability Trust (irrespective of the date the deceased acquired the asset), you need to know:\n\n\n\u2022the market value of the asset at the date of the person's death\n\u2022the amount of any relevant costs incurred by the executor or trustee.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the amount that the asset is taken to have cost you. If the executor or trustee has a valuation of the asset, get a copy of that valuation report. Otherwise, you will need to get your own valuation.\n\nIf the asset you inherit was acquired by the deceased person on or after 20 September 1985, you need to know full details of all relevant costs incurred by the deceased person and by the executor or trustee. Get those details from the executor or trustee.\n\n***Inheriting a main residence***\n\nIf you inherit a dwelling that was the deceased's main residence (for example, a house), any capital gain on its subsequent disposal may be exempt. However, until the exemption is certain, you should keep records of relevant costs incurred by you, the deceased or their trustee or executor.\n\nYou will not need to keep records of the deceased's costs if:\n\n\n\u2022you inherited the dwelling after 20 August 1996\n\u2022the dwelling was the deceased's main residence just before they died\n\u2022the dwelling was not being used to produce income at the time of death.\n\n\n\n\nIn these circumstances, you will be taken to have acquired the dwelling at its market value at the date of death. If the executor or trustee has a valuation of the asset, get a copy of that valuation report. Otherwise you will need to get your own valuation.\n\nIf you are a beneficiary of a deceased estate and a CGT event happens to your residential property in Australia that you inherited from an\n[excluded foreign resident](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATA4(EXCLUDEDFOREIGNRESIDENT)%22&PiT=99991231235958#A4(EXCLUDEDFOREIGNRESIDENT))\n(that is, a person who was a foreign resident for a continuous period of more than 6 years), you may no longer be entitled to claim the\n[main residence exemption](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/capital-gains-tax/foreign-residents-and-capital-gains-tax/main-residence-exemption-for-foreign-resits/)\nfor the deceased's ownership period. This does not apply to properties held before 7.30pm AEST on 9 May 2017 if:\n\n\n\u2022the CGT event occurred on or before 30 June 2020, and\n\u2022you, the deceased or their legal personal representative held an ownership interest in the asset at all times during the period immediately before 9 May 2017 until immediately before the CGT event.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, see\n[Inherited main residence](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATINHERITEDMAINRESIDENCE%22&PiT=99991231235958#INHERITEDMAINRESIDENCE)\n.\n\n***Records relating to foreign resident capital gains withholding***\n\nWhen the foreign resident capital gains withholding amount has been paid, we will issue confirmation to both the vendor and the purchaser. The vendor will be able to use this confirmation to help them complete their tax return to claim a credit for the foreign resident capital gains withholding amount.\n\n**Asset registers**\n\nYou can choose to enter information from your CGT records into an asset register. If you keep an asset register, you may be able to discard records that you might otherwise need to keep for a long time.\n\nIf you choose to keep an asset register, transfer the following information to it from the records you generally need to keep for CGT purposes:\n\n\n\u2022the date the asset was acquired\n\u2022the cost of the asset\n\u2022a description, amount and date for each cost associated with the purchase of the asset, for example, stamp duty and legal fees\n\u2022the date the CGT event happened to the asset\n\u2022the capital proceeds received when the CGT event happened.\n\n\n\n\nThis information must be certified by a registered tax agent or a person approved by the Commissioner.\n\nIf you use an asset register, you must keep the documents from which you have transferred the information for 5 years from the date the relevant asset register entry is certified. You must keep the asset register entries for 5 years from the date the related CGT event happens. Keep the asset register for a longer period if you need to substantiate any carried forward net capital losses, for 5 years after any CGT event where you have applied any capital loss against capital gains.\n\nFor more information, see Taxation Ruling\n[TR 2002/10](/law/view/document?LocID=%22TXR%2FTR200210%2FNAT%2FATO%22&PiT=99991231235958#ATO)\n*Income tax: capital gains tax: asset register.*\n\n**Exceptions**\n\nYou don't need to keep records if, for any CGT event, a capital gain or capital loss is disregarded in full. For example, you don't need to keep records for exempt assets such as cars and motorcycles as the capital gain or loss is disregarded in full.\n\n**It is never too late to keep records**\n\nIf you acquired assets on or after 20 September 1985 and did not keep records, or your records have inadvertently been destroyed, you can still do something about it.\n\nIf you bought real estate, your solicitor or real estate agent may have copies of most of the records you need. You should be able to get copies if you ask for them.\n\nIf you made improvements to an investment property, for example, if you built an extension, then ask for a copy of the builder's receipt for payment.\n\nIf you bought shares in a company or units in a unit trust, your stockbroker or investment adviser may be able to give you the information you need.\n\nIf you received an asset as a gift and you did not get a market valuation at the time, a professional valuer can tell you what its market value was at the relevant date.\n\nThe main thing is to get as many details as soon as possible so you can reconstruct your records. Make sure you keep sufficient records in the future.\n\n### Trust distributions and your CGT position\n\nExplains how distributions from trusts (including managed funds) can affect your CGT position. Managed funds include property trusts, share trusts, equity trusts, growth trusts, imputation trusts and balanced trusts.\n\n**On this page**\n\n\n\u2022[Distributions from a trust](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATDISTRIBUTIONSFROMATRUST%22&PiT=99991231235958#DISTRIBUTIONSFROMATRUST)\n\u2022[Attribution managed investment trusts](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATATTRIBUTIONMANAGEDINVESTMENTTRUSTS%22&PiT=99991231235958#ATTRIBUTIONMANAGEDINVESTMENTTRUSTS)\n\u2022[Capital gains made by a trust](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCAPITALGAINSMADEBYATRUST%22&PiT=99991231235958#CAPITALGAINSMADEBYATRUST)\n\u2022[Non-assessable payments from a trust](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATNON-ASSESSABLEPAYMENTSFROMATRUST%22&PiT=99991231235958#NON-ASSESSABLEPAYMENTSFROMATRUST)\n\n\n\n\n**Distributions from a trust**\n\nDistributions from trusts can include different amounts but only the following amounts are relevant for CGT purposes:\n\n\n\u2022distributions of all or a part of the trust's income where the trust's net income for tax purposes includes a net capital gain\n\u2022distributions or other entitlements described as being referable to a specific capital gain or gains\n\u2022distributions of non-assessable amounts.\n\n\n\n\nFrom 2024, if you have received a capital gain distribution from a trust, you will also need to complete a\n*Trust income schedule*\nwhich details each distribution that you have received.\n\nYou are treated as having made a capital gain or gains if you are 'specifically entitled' to all or part of a trust's capital gain and that capital gain is reflected in the trust's net income for tax purposes.\n\nAdditionally, if there is an amount of a capital gain reflected in the net income of the trust for tax purposes to which no entity is specifically entitled, that amount will be proportionately assessed to beneficiaries in accordance with their 'adjusted Division 6 percentage' (which is based on their proportionate entitlement to certain income of the trust), or otherwise to the trustee.\n\nIn certain circumstances where you would be treated as having made a capital gain but are unable to benefit from the gain within a set period, an eligible trustee may elect to be assessed on the capital gain on your behalf.\n\nIn June 2011, amendments were enacted that enable the streaming of capital gains and franked dividends to beneficiaries, subject to relevant integrity provisions. For\n[managed investment trusts](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/trusts/in-detail/managed-investment-trusts/managed-investment-trusts-overview)\n(MITs) which have not previously made an election to apply the amendments, the amendments start to apply from 2017\u201318. For MITs which have previously made an election to apply the amendments, the amendments continue to apply in 2017\u201318 and later income years.\n\nThese amendments don't apply to MITs that are attribution managed investment trusts (AMITs). They are subject to the separate attribution rules that enable capital gains and franked distributions to be attributed to members for tax purposes.\n\nNon-assessable payments mostly affect the cost base of units in a unit trust (including managed funds) but can in some cases create a capital gain. Non-assessable payments to beneficiaries of a discretionary trust will not give rise to capital gains.\n\nTrustees, including fund managers, may use different terms to describe the methods of calculation and other terms used in this guide. For example, they may use the term 'non-discount gains' when they refer to capital gains worked out using the indexation and 'other' methods.\n\n**Attribution managed investment trusts**\n\nAn eligible MIT may choose to apply the attribution rules in Division 276 of the\n*Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.*\nWhere that choice is made, the MIT becomes known as an attribution managed investment trust (AMIT).\n\nGenerally, those rules apply to 'attribute' amounts to each member based on their interest in the AMIT, rather than a 'present entitlement' to the net income of the trust or the amount actually paid.\n\nThe attribution rules ensure that amounts from the trust retain their tax character as they flow through to you. This is so that for taxation purposes it is treated as if you had earned the income directly in your own right. In relation to capital gains, those rules mean you will treat the capital gains component of your trust income as your own capital gain.\n\nThese rules also mean that the cost base of your units in an AMIT may have annual upward or downward adjustments.\n\nYour share of trust amounts attributed to you is shown on your member statement, which for an AMIT is called an AMIT member annual statement (AMMA) (similar to the standard distribution statement provided by a managed fund).\n\nOtherwise, for members (unit holders) of an AMIT, there will be little discernible difference to the way income is distributed to you.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Cost base adjustments for AMIT members](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCOSTBASEADJUSTMENTSFORAMITMEMBERS%22&PiT=99991231235958#COSTBASEADJUSTMENTSFORAMITMEMBERS)\n.\n\n**Corporate Collective Investment Vehicles**\n\nFrom 1 July 2022, a new form of collective investment vehicle is available for funds management activities \u2013 a\n[corporate collective investment vehicle (CCIV)](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/corporate-tax-measures-and-assurance/public-business-and-international/collective-investment-vehicles/corporate-collective-investment-vehicles)\n.\n\nFrom a regulatory perspective, a CCIV is a registered company that comprises one or more 'sub-funds' and is operated by a single corporate director. A sub-fund of a CCIV is all or part of the CCIV's business that is registered as a sub-fund of the CCIV by ASIC. However, the tax framework treats each CCIV sub-fund as a separate fixed unit trust. A CCIV sub-fund is subject to the existing rules for the taxation of trusts.\n\nA CCIV sub-fund trust is taxed as an AMIT for an income year under the attribution regime in Division 276 of the\n*Income Tax Assessment Act 1997*\nif it meets certain AMIT eligibility criteria. We call this an 'attribution CCIV sub-fund trust'.\n\nAn attribution CCIV sub-fund trust, as a deemed AMIT, is required to provide an AMMA statement to each of its members. If a CCIV sub-fund trust does not meet the requirements to be an AMIT, it will be taxed under Division 6 of the\n*Income Tax Assessment Act 1936*\nand will provide distribution information to beneficiaries through a standard distribution statement (SDS).\n\n**Capital gains made by a trust**\n\nThe general trust taxation provisions in Division 6 of the\n*Income Tax Assessment Act 1936*\n(Division 6) give way to specific rules in Division 115-C of the\n*Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.*\nThese rules ensure that, where permitted by the trust deed, the capital gains of a trust (other than an AMIT) can be effectively streamed to beneficiaries for tax purposes by making them 'specifically entitled' to those gains. Generally, a beneficiary will be considered specifically entitled to an amount of a capital gain if the beneficiary has received (or can reasonably be expected to receive) an amount referrable to that gain, and certain recording conditions are satisfied.\n\nA beneficiary specifically entitled to a capital gain will generally be assessed in respect of that gain, regardless of whether the benefit they receive or are expected to receive is income or capital of the trust.\n\nCapital gains to which no beneficiary is specifically entitled will be allocated proportionately to beneficiaries based on their present entitlement to income of the trust estate (excluding amounts of capital gains and franked distributions to which any entity is specifically entitled). This proportion is known as the beneficiary's 'adjusted Division 6 percentage'. If there is some income to which no beneficiary is entitled (apart from capital gains and/or franked distributions to which any entity is specifically entitled) the trustee may be assessed under section 99 or 99A of the ITAA 1936.\n\nThe trust provisions also allow the trustee of a resident trust to choose to be assessed on a capital gain, provided no beneficiary has received or benefited from any amount relating to the gain during 2023\u201324 or within 2 months of 30 June 2024.\n\n***Question 13 in the supplementary tax return for individuals***\n\nQuestion\n**13**\nin the\n*Tax return for individuals (supplementary section) 2024*\ntells you to exclude net capital gains from the amount of trust income you write at question\n**13**\n\u2013 label\n**U**\nin your supplementary tax return. In your statement of distribution or advice, the trust should state your share of the trust's net capital gain. Exclude only so much of the trust's net capital gain that would otherwise form part of your share of the trust income.\n\n***For beneficiaries of trusts***\n\n*Step 1: Determine your share of the capital gain of the trust*\n\nFollow the steps below to answer question 13 for beneficiaries of trusts.\n\nYou will need to determine whether you have a share of each capital gain made by the trust that has been included in the trust's net income for tax purposes. For every capital gain you have a share of, your statement of distribution or advice from the trust should advise you of:\n\n\n\u2022your share of that gain\n\u2022how much of the net income of the trust for tax purposes relates to each gain (or what is the 'attributable gain' to which your share relates)\n\u2022the type of capital gain to which your share relates and the method used by the trustee to calculate it (including any CGT discount or small business CGT concessions applied)\n\u2022your share of any credit for a foreign resident capital gains withholding amount.\n\n\n\n\nYour share of a capital gain is any amount of the capital gain to which you are\n[specifically entitled](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATA4(SPECIFICALLYENTITLED)%22&PiT=99991231235958#A4(SPECIFICALLYENTITLED))\nplus your\n[adjusted Division 6 percentage](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATA4(ADJUSTEDDIVISION6PERCENTAGE)%22&PiT=99991231235958#A4(ADJUSTEDDIVISION6PERCENTAGE))\nshare of any amount of the capital gain to which no beneficiary is\n**specifically entitled.**\n\nThese rules don't apply to a distribution of a capital gain by an AMIT.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Managed investment trusts](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/managed-investment-trusts)\n.\n\n*Step 2: Divide by the total capital gain*\n\nThat amount is then divided by the total capital gain to give you your 'fraction' of the total capital gain.\n\n*Step 3: Multiply your fraction of the capital gain by the trust's taxable income relating to the capital gain*\n\nYour fraction is then multiplied by the net income for tax purposes of the trust that relates to the capital gain. The result is your 'attributable gain'.\n\nIn certain circumstances where the trust's net capital gain and total net franked distributions exceed the net income of the trust for tax purposes, the amount of the trust's taxable income relating to the capital gain is rateably reduced. This ensures that beneficiaries and the trustee can't be assessed on more than the total net income of the trust.\n\n***Extra capital gains you are taken to have made***\n\nIf you are a beneficiary who is taken to have an 'attributable gain' (your share of a trust's capital gain included in its net income for tax purposes), you are taken to have made extra capital gains in addition to any other capital gains you may have made from your own CGT events.\n\nThese extra capital gains are taken into account in working out your net capital gain for 2023\u201324. You include them at step 2 in:\n\n\n\u2022[Instructions for individuals completing their tax return](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATC4%22&PiT=99991231235958#C4)\n\u2013 for individuals\n\u2022[Capital gains tax schedule and instructions 2024](https://www.ato.gov.au/forms-and-instructions/capital-gains-tax-schedule-2024-instructions)\n\u2013 for companies, trusts and funds.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to work out the amount of extra capital gains that are taken into account in working out your own net capital gain, you will need to know the method used by the trustee in calculating the trust's capital gains that were included in the trust's net capital gain. Your statement of distribution or advice should show this information.\n\nIf you are a unit holder in a managed fund, the trustee or manager will generally advise you of your share of the trust's net capital gain, together with details of your share of any other income distributed to you.\n\nIn other cases, the trustee may have advised you what your share is or you may need to contact them to obtain details.\n\n***Trust distributions to which the CGT concessions apply***\n\nYour 'attributable gain' is then grossed-up as appropriate for any CGT concessions (the general CGT discount or the small business 50% reduction) applied by the trustee to that capital gain. You have an extra capital gain equal to the grossed-up amount.\n\nWhere the trustee reduced the capital gain by the CGT discount or the small business 50% active asset reduction, you need to gross up your 'attributable gain' by multiplying it by 2. This grossed-up amount is an extra capital gain.\n\nYou multiply by 4 your attributable gain that the trust has reduced by both the CGT discount and the small business 50% active asset reduction. This grossed-up amount is an extra capital gain.\n\nIf the capital gain has not been reduced by either the CGT discount or the small business 50% active asset reduction, then your 'attributable gain' is an extra capital gain.\n\nYou are then able to reduce your extra capital gains by any current or prior year capital losses that you have, and then apply any relevant discounts to work out your own net capital gain.\n\n***No double taxation***\n\nYou are not taxed twice on these extra capital gains because you didn't include your capital gains from trusts at question\n**13**\nin your supplementary tax return.\n\n**Example 16: applying the trust provisions**\n> **Step 1: Determine the beneficiary's share of the capital gain of the trust**\n\n> The Cropper Trust generated $100 of rent and a $500 capital gain (which was a discount capital gain). The trust also had a capital loss of $100. The trust deed does not define 'income' and therefore capital gains don't form part of the trust income. As a result, the income of the trust estate is $100 (being an amount equal to the rent), whereas the net income of the trust for tax purposes is $300. The $300 net income for tax purposes comprises the $200 net capital gain (which is the $500 capital gain less the $100 capital loss, reduced by the 50% CGT discount) plus the $100 rent income.\n\n> The trustee resolves to distribute $200 related to the capital gain (after absorbing the capital loss) to Shane and the $100 of rent to Andrea.\n\n> Shane is specifically entitled to 50% of the $500 capital gain because he can reasonably be expected to receive the economic benefit of 50% of the $400 capital gain remaining ($200) after accounting for the $100 capital loss. Shane's share of the capital gain equals the amount to which he is specifically entitled namely $250 (50% of the $500 capital gain).\n\n> Andrea's share of the capital gain is also $250 because, being entitled to all of the $100 income of the trust (none of the capital gain being treated as trust income), she has an adjusted Division 6 percentage of 100% and there is $250 of the $500 capital gain to which no one is specifically entitled.\n\n> **Step 2: Divide by the total capital gain**\n\n> Shane divides his share of the capital gain ($250) by the total capital gain ($500) and therefore has a fraction share of one-half of the capital gain.\n\n> Andrea divides her share of the capital gain ($250) by the total capital gain ($500) and therefore also has a fraction share of one-half of the capital gain.\n\n> **Step 3: Multiply the beneficiary's fraction of the capital gain by the trust's taxable income relating to the capital gain**\n\n> The net income of the trust for tax purposes relating to the capital gain is $200.\n\n> Shane's attributable gain is $100 ($200 \u00d7 one-half).\n\n> Andrea's attributable gain is $100 ($200 \u00d7 one-half).\n\n> **Step 4: Gross up the amount for CGT discounts applied by the trustee**\n\n> Shane is required to double his attributable gain of $100 to an extra capital gain of $200 because the trustee had applied the 50% CGT discount.\n\n> Andrea similarly doubles her attributable gain to $200 which is her extra capital gain.\n\n> Both Shane and Andrea will take their extra capital gain of $200 into account in working out their own net capital gain at question\n> **18.**\n> Shane and Andrea are individuals entitled to claim the 50% CGT discount. Neither have other capital gains or capital losses of their own to apply against their extra capital gains. Therefore, after applying the 50% CGT discount to their $200 extra capital gain, they will have made a net capital gain of $100 ($200 extra capital gain \u00d7 50% = $100). They will write $100 at question\n> **18 Capital gains**\n> \u2013 label\n> **A**\n> in their supplementary tax returns. They also write $200 (which is $100 grossed-up) at question\n> **18**\n> \u2013 label\n> **H.**\n\n> Note that Shane and Andrea's statement of distribution or advice from the trust advised each of them that the trust had made a capital gain of $500, that only $200 of this had been included in the net income of the trust estate for tax purposes, that the 50% discount had been applied and that their share of the gain was $250. Alternatively, it could have advised them that they each had an extra capital gain of $200 that was a discount capital gain.\n\n\n\n\n\n***Applying the concessions***\n\nYou must use the same method as the trust to calculate your capital gain.\n\nThis means you can't apply the CGT discount to capital gains distributed to you from the trust which were calculated using the indexation method or 'other' method.\n\nYou can only apply the small business 50% active asset reduction to grossed-up capital gains to which the trust applied that concession.\n\n**Example 17: distribution where the trust claimed concessions**\n> Serge is the sole beneficiary in the Shadows Unit Trust. His statement of distribution or advice from the trust shows that his 100% share of the net income of the Shadows Unit Trust for income tax purposes was $2,000. The $2,000 includes a net capital gain of $250 (made of a $1,000 capital gain that was reduced by the CGT discount and the small business 50% active asset reduction).\n\n> His statement advises him that he has a 100% share of the capital gain which is $1,000.\n\n> Because he has a 100% share of the capital gain, Serge will have an 'attributable gain' of $250 (that is, the whole of the net income of the trust estate for tax purposes that relates to the gain).\n\n> Due to the application of the CGT discount and the small business 50% active asset reduction, Serge then grosses up his 'attributable gain' of $250 by multiplying it by 4 to $1,000 which is his extra capital gain.\n\n> Serge has also made a capital loss of $100 from the sale of shares.\n\n> He calculates his own net capital gain as follows.\n\n> 1. Serge's extra capital gain (that is, his $250 attributable gain \u00d7 4) is $1,000.\n\n> 2.\n> *Subtract*\n> capital losses of $100.\n\n> 3. The capital gains before applying discounts is $900.\n\n> 4. Apply the CGT discount of 50% ($450).\n\n> 5. Apply the 50% active asset reduction of $225.\n\n> 6. The total net capital gain is\n> **$225.**\n\n> Serge will write $1,000 at question\n> **18**\n> \u2013 label\n> **H**\n> in his supplementary tax return, which is his total current year capital gain. The net capital gain he will write at question\n> **18**\n> \u2013 label\n> **A**\n> in his supplementary tax return is $225. He will write a trust distribution of $1,750 ($2,000 - $250) at question\n> **13**\n> \u2013 label\n> **U**\n> in his supplementary tax return.\n\n\n\n\n\n***Investors in managed funds***\n\nIf you are a unit holder in a managed fund and have received a distribution from a trust that includes a net capital gain, take your share of that net capital gain into account in working out your own net capital gain for the year, to the extent that it does not exceed the overall net amount of your distribution from the trust; see\nexamples 18 and 19\n.\n\nYour statement of distribution or advice should show your share of the trust net capital gain and other information relevant to that gain, including your share of any credit for a foreign resident capital gains withholding amount.\n\nIf your statement shows that your share of the trust's net capital gain is more than the overall net amount of your distribution, then there is a limit on the amount of the capital gain component you exclude from question\n**13 Partnerships and trusts**\n\u2013 label\n**L**\nin your supplementary tax return. In this situation, you can't exclude an amount greater than the overall net amount of your distribution from the trust; see\nexamples 18 and 19\n. The amount of your share of the trust's net capital gain you exclude from the amount at question\n**13 Partnerships and trusts**\n\u2013 label\n**L**\nis used in working out your capital gain. If you receive a distribution from more than one trust, this applies to each distribution.\n\n***Trust distributions to which the CGT concessions apply***\n\nYour statement should show whether any discounts or reductions were applied by the trustee in determining the amount of the capital gain.\n\nIf you have a share of a trust's net capital gain you are taken to have made extra capital gains in addition to any other capital gains you may have made from your own CGT events.\n\nThese extra capital gains are taken into account in working out your net capital gain for 2023\u201324. You include them at step 2 in:\n\n\n\u2022[Instructions for individuals completing their tax return](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATC4%22&PiT=99991231235958#C4)\n\u2013 for individuals\n\u2022[Capital gains tax schedule and instructions 2024](https://www.ato.gov.au/forms-and-instructions/capital-gains-tax-schedule-2024-instructions)\n\u2013 for companies, trusts and funds.\n\n\n\n\nYou need to know whether the trustee applied any discounts or reductions in calculating the capital gain to which your share relates in order to work out the correct amount to include in your own net capital gain calculation.\n\nWhere the trustee reduced one or more capital gains by the CGT discount or the small business 50% active asset reduction, you need to gross up your share of any such capital gain by multiplying it by 2. This grossed-up amount is your extra capital gain that you include in your own net capital gain calculation.\n\nYou multiply by 4 your share of any capital gain from a trust that the trustee has reduced by both the CGT discount and the small business 50% active asset reduction. This grossed-up amount is your extra capital gain that you include in your own net capital gain calculation.\n\nIf your share of a capital gain from a trust is attributable to a capital gain that the trustee has not reduced by one of these concessions, that amount is your extra capital gain. You include this amount in your own net capital gain calculation.\n\nThis calculation lets you reduce your extra capital gains by any current or prior year capital losses that you have, and then apply any relevant discounts to work out your own net capital gain; see\nexample 19\n.\n\n***No double taxation***\n\nYou are not taxed twice on these extra capital gains because you did not include your capital gains from trusts at question\n**13**\nin your supplementary tax return.\n\n**Example 18: capital gain greater than share of trust net income and capital gain was discounted**\n> Daniel's statement of distribution or advice from a managed fund (other than an AMIT) shows that his share of the net income of that trust for tax purposes was $7,000.\n\n> This is made up of his $3,000 proportionate share of the trust's non-primary production loss and his $10,000 proportionate share of the trust's net capital gain to which the trust applied the 50% CGT discount. Daniel also made a $2,000 capital loss during the year on the sale of some shares. He does not have any other trust distributions for the year.\n\n> Daniel writes zero at question\n> **13 Partnerships and Trusts**\n> in his supplementary tax return. He takes $14,000 (that is, the $7,000 remaining of his share of the capital gain from the trust grossed-up) into account in working out his net capital gain at question\n> **18**\n> . Therefore, after subtracting the capital losses from the grossed-up capital gain:\n> \n> \n> \u2022he is taken to have made ($14,000 - $2,000 = $12,000)\n> \u2022he applies the 50% CGT discount ($12,000 \u00d7 50% = $6,000)\n> \u2022he writes $6,000 at question\n> **18 Capital gains**\n> \u2013 label\n> **A**\n> in his supplementary tax return\n> \u2022he writes $14,000 ($7,000 grossed-up) at question\n> **18**\n> \u2013 label\n> **H**\n> .\n\n\n\n**Example 19: capital gain greater than share of trust net income and capital gain was not discounted**\n> Debra's statement of distribution or advice from a Managed Fund (other than an AMIT) shows that her share of the net income of that trust for tax purposes was $2,000.\n\n> This is made up of her $5,000 proportionate share of the trust's primary production loss, her $2,000 proportionate share of the trust's non-primary production income and her $5,000 proportionate share of the trust's net capital gain. The trust's net capital gain does not include any discounted gains.\n\n> At question\n> **13 Partnerships and Trusts**\n> in her supplementary tax return, Debra will write $5,000 loss from primary production at label\n> **L**\n> and $5,000 non-primary production income at label\n> **U**\n> (that is, $2,000 non-primary production income plus sufficient net capital gain [$3,000] to offset the loss from primary production).\n\n> Assuming Debra has no other capital gains or capital losses, she will write $2,000 ($5,000 - $3,000) at question\n> **18 Capital gains**\n> \u2013 label\n> **H**\n> and\n> **A**\n> in her supplementary tax return.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Non-assessable payments from a trust**\n\nTrusts often make non-assessable payments to beneficiaries.\n\nIf a profit made by the trust is not assessable, any part of that profit distributed to a beneficiary will also be non-assessable in most cases, for example, a share of a profit made on the sale of property acquired by the trust before 20 September 1985.\n\nHowever, if you receive non-assessable payments from a trust, you may need to make cost base adjustments to your units or trust interest. Those adjustments will affect the amount of any capital gain or capital loss you make on the unit or interest, for example, when you sell it.\n\nNon-assessable payments may be made over a number of years. If non-assessable payments exceed your cost base, you may also make a capital gain equal to the excess in the year the excess is paid to you.\n\nNon-assessable payments from a managed fund to a unit holder are common and may be shown on your statement from the fund as:\n\n\n\u2022tax-free amounts\n\u2022CGT-concession amounts\n\u2022tax-exempted amounts\n\u2022tax-deferred amounts.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a beneficiary in a trust which is subject to the trust provisions relating to\n['streaming' of capital gains and franked distributions](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/trusts/in-detail/distributions/streaming-trust-capital-gains-and-franked-distributions)\n, even if you are distributed an amount that is described as a CGT concession amount, you may be taken to have made a capital gain. You will need to include this in your own net capital gain calculation.\n\nYou may need to adjust the cost base and reduced cost base of your units depending on the kind of non-assessable payment you received. If you hold an interest in an AMIT, the adjustment may either increase or decrease your cost base and reduced cost base. For more information, see\n[Cost-base adjustments for AMIT members](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCOSTBASEADJUSTMENTSFORAMITMEMBERS%22&PiT=99991231235958#COSTBASEADJUSTMENTSFORAMITMEMBERS)\n.\n\nYour statement of distribution or advice should show amounts and other information relevant to your cost base or reduced cost base.\n\nTax-free amounts relate to certain tax concessions received by the fund which enable it to pay greater distributions to its unit holders. If your statement shows any tax-free amounts, you adjust the reduced cost base (but not your cost base) of your units by these amounts. Payments of amounts associated with building allowances which were made before 1 July 2001 were treated as tax-free amounts.\n\nCGT-concession amounts relate to the CGT discount component of any actual distribution. Such amounts don't affect your cost base and reduced cost base if they were received after 30 June 2001. A CGT-concession amount received before 1 July 2001 is taken off the cost base and reduced cost base.\n\nTax-exempted amounts are generally made up of:\n\n\n\u2022exempt income of the fund\n\u2022amounts on which the fund has already paid tax\n\u2022income you had to repay to the fund.\n\n\n\n\nSuch amounts don't affect your cost base and reduced cost base.\n\nTax-deferred amounts are other non-assessable amounts, including indexation received by the fund on its capital gains and accounting differences in income. You adjust the cost base and reduced cost base of your units by these amounts. Payments associated with building allowances which are made on or after 1 July 2001 are treated as tax-deferred amounts.\n\nIf the tax-deferred amount is greater than the cost base of your units, you include the excess as a capital gain. You can use the indexation method if you bought your units before 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999. However, if you do so, you can't use the discount method to work out your capital gain when you later sell the units or trust interest.\n\n***Capital loss***\n\nYou can't make a capital loss from a non-assessable payment.\n\nAs a result of recent stapling arrangements, some investors in managed funds have received units which have a very low cost base. The payment of certain non-assessable amounts in excess of the cost base of the units will result in these investors making a capital gain.\n\n***Non-assessable payments under a demerger***\n\nIf you receive a non-assessable payment under an eligible demerger, you don't deduct the payment from the cost base and the reduced cost base of your units or trust interest. Instead, you adjust your cost base and reduced cost base according to the demerger rules.\n\nYou may make a capital gain on the non-assessable payment if it exceeds the cost base of your original unit or trust interest, although you will be able to choose a CGT rollover.\n\nAn eligible demerger is one that happens on or after 1 July 2002 and satisfies certain tests. The trust making the non-assessable payment will normally advise unit or trust interest holders if this is the case.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Investments in shares and units](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATINVESTMENTSINSHARESANDUNITS%22&PiT=99991231235958#INVESTMENTSINSHARESANDUNITS)\n.\n\n***Cost base adjustments***\n\nGenerally, you make any adjustment to the cost base and reduced cost base of your unit or trust interest at the end of the income year. However, if some other CGT event happens to the unit or trust interest during the year (for example, you sell your units), you must adjust the cost base and reduced cost base just before the time of that CGT event. The amount of the adjustment is based on the amount of non-assessable payments paid to you up to the date of sale. You use the adjusted cost base and reduced cost base to\n[work out your capital gain or capital loss](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATHOWTOWORKOUTYOURCAPITALGAINORCAPITALLOSS%22&PiT=99991231235958#HOWTOWORKOUTYOURCAPITALGAINORCAPITALLOSS)\n.\n\nThe cost base and reduced cost base adjustments are more complex if you deducted capital losses from a grossed-up capital gain where a capital gain made by the trust was reduced by the small business 50% active asset reduction. If this applies to you, you may need to seek advice from us on how to make the adjustments.\n\n**Example 20: receiving a non-assessable amount**\n> Bob owns units in OZ Investments Fund (a managed fund that is not an AMIT and has not elected to apply the 2011 changes to the rules relating to capital gains made by trusts) which distributed income to him for the 2023\u201324 income year.

Ilena has no unapplied net capital losses from earlier years.\n\n> From her records, Ilena knows the cost base and reduced cost base of her units are $5,000 and $4,700 respectively.\n\n> Ilena has to treat the capital gain component of her share of the fund's net income for tax purposes as if she made the capital gain. To complete her tax return, Ilena must identify this capital gain component and work out her net capital gain.\n\n> The following steps show how Ilena works out the amount to write at question\n> **18**\n> \u2013 label\n> **H**\n> in her supplementary tax return.\n\n> **Step 1**\n> As Ilena has a share of a capital gain which the fund reduced by the CGT discount of 50% (her discounted share being $65), she must gross up her share of this capital gain. She does this by multiplying the amount of her share of the discounted capital gain by 2:\n> \n> `$65 \u00d7 2 = $130`\n\n> **Step 2**\n> Ilena adds her share of the trust's grossed-up and non-discounted capital gains to work out her total current year capital gains:\n> \n> `$130 + $90 = $220`\n\n> She writes her total current year capital gains ($220) at question\n> **18**\n> \u2013 label\n> **H**\n> in her supplementary tax return.\n\n> **Step 3**\n> After Ilena has grossed-up her share of the fund's discounted capital gain, she subtracts her capital losses from her capital gains.\n\n> Ilena can choose which capital gains she subtracts the capital losses from first. In her case, she gets the better result if she:\n> \n> \n> \u2022subtracts as much as possible of her capital losses (which were $100) from her non-discounted capital gains ($90).\n> \n> `$90 - $90 = $0 (non-discounted capital gains)`\n> \n> \n> \u2022subtracts her remaining capital losses after step 1 ($10) from her discounted capital gains ($130).\n> \n> `$130 - $10 = $120 (discounted capital gains)`\n> \n> \n> \u2022applies the CGT discount to her remaining discounted capital gains:\n> \n> `($120 \u00d7 50%) = $60 (discounted capital gains)`\n\n> **Step 4**\n> Finally, Ilena adds up the capital gains remaining to arrive at her net capital gain:\n> \n> `$0 (non-discounted) + $60 (discounted) = $60 net capital gain.`\n\n> Ilena completes question\n> **18**\n> in her supplementary tax return as follows:\n> \n> ![](/law/view/sgif/sos_sgml/gcgt20220701b.gif \"Question 18 Capital gains, Label G Did you have a capital gains tax event during the year is marked X at 'yes', Label M Have you applied an exemption or rollover? is marked X at 'no'.

Tax-free and tax-deferred amounts may reduce the cost base of your units, while tax-exempt amounts don't affect the cost base; see\n[Trust non-assessable payments (CGT event E4)](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/capital-gains-tax/shares-and-similar-investments/trust-non-assessable-payments-cgt-event-e4)\n.\n\nUnder the new tax system for managed investment trusts, the cost base of your units can be adjusted both upwards and downwards (upwards adjustments were not previously allowed).\n\nYour statement of distribution or advice or AMIT Member Annual statement (AMMA) should show amounts and other information relevant to your cost base or reduced cost base.\n\nThe AMIT will calculate a cost base net amount. The cost base net amount is the balance of your cost base reduction amount and your cost base increase amount.\n\n**Example 21A: AMIT cost base net adjustment**\n> Miriam owns units in the Exponential Growth Fund, which has elected into the new tax system for managed investment trusts in 2023\u201324 and is therefore an AMIT.\n\n> The fund\n> **attributes**\n> $13 per unit to Miriam for 2023\u201324 but pays a cash amount of $3 per unit. The balance of $10 is retained by Exponential Growth Fund for reinvestment, rather than paid as a cash distribution. Miriam includes the $13 attributed amount in her assessable income as 'Share of net income from trusts' at question\n> **13 Partnerships and trusts.**\n\n> **Cost base consequences**\n\n> The $13 attributed to Miriam is added to her cost base of $55, while the actual payment of $3 is taken away from her cost base. In this way, the cost base increase is netted off against the cost base reduction, resulting in a cost base net increase of $10 per unit. The cost base increase and cost base reduction are shown in Miriam's AMMA statement, along with a cost base net amount of $10.\n\n> The $10 cost base net amount is not included in Miriam's assessable income or capital gains because it represents amounts that have already been taxed to her on attribution, but is used to increase the cost base of her units in Exponential Growth Fund for future years. Miriam will need to include it in her cost base calculations when she eventually sells her units in the fund, to ensure that the undistributed amount attributed to her is not double taxed as a capital gain.\n\n> Miriam works it out as follows:\n> \n> \n> \u2022cost base per unit is $55\n> \u2022*add*\n> taxable income\n> **attributed**\n> in 2023\u201324 of $13\n> \u2022*subtract*\n> cash dividend for 2023\u201324 of $3\n> \u2022new cost base per unit is\n> **$65.**\n\n\n\n\n\nThe amounts attributed to you to be included in your assessable income, as well as any non-assessable non-exempt income related to your CGT asset, are added to the cost base amount of your units in the AMIT. Cash payments you receive in relation to your units are taken away from their cost base. Any reductions and increases are netted off against each other to arrive at your cost base net amount.\n\nAny excess cost base net amount is used to reduce your unit's cost base. If the excess is greater than your cost base it will reduce your cost base to nil. Any remaining excess will result in a capital gain. If the excess is less than your cost base your cost base amount will be decreased, which may result in a greater capital gain or reduced capital loss on the disposal of your membership interests in the AMIT.\n\nAny shortfall in the cost base net amount is used to increase your asset's cost base and reduced cost base. This may result in a reduced capital gain or increased capital loss on disposal of your assets.\n\nFor more information, see Law Companion Ruling\n[LCR 2015/11](/law/view/document?LocID=%22COG%2FLCG201511%2FNAT%2FATO%22&PiT=99991231235958#ATO)\n*Attribution Managed Investment Trusts: annual cost base adjustments for units in an AMIT and associated transitional rules.*\n\n### Investments in shares and units\n\nExplains your CGT obligations if you sold or otherwise disposed of any shares or units in a unit trust (including a managed fund) in the 2023\u201324 income year.

Where we refer to a unit trust in this guide we are also referring to a managed fund.\n\n**How capital gains tax affects shares and units**\n\nFor CGT purposes, shares in a company or units in a unit trust are treated in the same way as any other assets.\n\nAs a general rule, if you acquired any shares or units on or after 20 September 1985, you may have to pay tax on any capital gain you make when a CGT event happens to them. This would usually be when you sell or otherwise dispose of them. It also includes where you redeem units in a managed fund by switching them from one fund to another. In these cases, CGT event A1 happens. There is a list of all CGT events at\n[Appendix 1](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATA1%22&PiT=99991231235958#A1)\n.\n\nProfits on the sale of shares held in carrying on a business of share trading are included as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, if the\n[TOFA rules](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/corporate-tax-measures-and-assurance/taxation-of-financial-arrangements-tofa/in-detail/guide-to-the-taxation-of-financial-arrangements-tofa)\napply to you and you have elected to have certain tax-timing methods apply, gains and losses from trading of shares and units will be brought to account under those rules rather than as capital gains or capital losses.\n\nCapital gains or losses made in respect of certain CGT events happening to shares held by an Australian resident company that represents a non-portfolio interest in foreign companies may be reduced under Subdivision 768-G of the ITAA 1997 depending on the active foreign business asset percentage of the foreign company, see\n[Foreign income return form guide](https://www.ato.gov.au/Forms/Foreign-income-return-form-guide/)\n.\n\nA CGT event might happen to shares even if a change in their ownership is involuntary, for example, if the company in which you hold shares is taken over or merges with another company. This may result in a capital gain or capital loss.\n\nThis section also deals with the receipt of non-assessable payments from a company (CGT event G1) while\n[Trust distributions and your CGT position](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATTRUSTDISTRIBUTIONS%22&PiT=99991231235958#TRUSTDISTRIBUTIONS)\ndeals with non-assessable payments from a trust (CGT event E4 or E10).\n\nIf you own shares in a company that has been placed in liquidation or administration, CGT event G3 lets you choose to make a capital loss when the liquidator or administrator declares the shares (or other financial instruments) worthless.\n\nThere are a number of special CGT rules if you receive such things as bonus shares, bonus units, rights, options or non-assessable payments from a company or trust. Special rules also apply if you buy convertible notes or participate in an employee share scheme or a dividend reinvestment plan.\n\nThe rest of this section explains these rules and has examples showing how they work in practice. The flowcharts at\n[Appendix 3](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATA3%22&PiT=99991231235958#A3)\nwill also help you work out whether the special rules apply to you.\n\nFor more information, see:\n\n\n\u2022[Share investing versus share trading](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Capital-gains-tax/Shares-and-similar-investments/Share-investing-versus-share-trading/)\n\u2022[You and your shares 2024](https://www.ato.gov.au/forms-and-instructions/you-and-your-shares-2024)\n\n\n\n\n**Identifying shares or units sold**\n\nSometimes taxpayers own shares or units that they may have acquired at different times. This can happen as people decide to increase their investment in a particular company or unit trust. A common question people ask when they dispose of only part of their investment is how to identify the particular shares or units they have disposed of.\n\nThis can be very important because shares or units bought at different times may have different amounts included in their cost base. In calculating the capital gain or capital loss when disposing of only part of an investment, you need to be able to identify which shares or units you have disposed of. Also, when you dispose of any shares or units you acquired before 20 September 1985, any capital gain or capital loss you make is generally disregarded.\n\nIf you have the relevant records (for example, share certificates), you may be able to identify which particular shares or units you have disposed of. In other cases, the Commissioner will accept your selection of the identity of shares disposed of.\n\nAlternatively, you may wish to use a 'first in, first out' basis where you treat the first shares or units you bought as being the first you disposed of.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we will also accept an average cost method to determine the cost of the shares disposed of. You can only use this average cost method when:\n\n\n\u2022the shares are in the same company\n\u2022the shares are acquired on the same day\n\u2022the shares have identical rights and obligations, and\n\u2022you are not required to use market value for cost base purposes.\n\n\n**Example 22: identifying when shares or units were acquired**\n> Boris bought 1,000 shares in WOA Ltd on 1 July 1998. He bought another 3,000 shares in the company on 1 July 2003.\n\n> In December 2003, WOA Ltd issued Boris with a CHESS statement for his 4,000 shares. When he sold 1,500 of the shares on 1 January 2024, he was not sure whether they were the shares he bought in 2003 or whether they included the shares bought in 1998.\n\n> Because Boris could not identify when he bought the particular shares he sold, he decided to use the 'first in, first out' method and nominated the 1,000 shares bought in 1997 plus 500 of the shares bought in 2002.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Demutualisation of life insurance and general insurance companies**\n\nIf you hold a policy in a life insurance company or a general insurance company that demutualises, you may be subject to CGT. This may be either at the time of the demutualisation or when you sell your shares (or another CGT event happens).\n\nA company demutualises when it changes its membership interests to shares, for example, AMP, IOOF and NRMA. (There are similar rules for non-insurance organisations that demutualise).\n\nThe insurance company may give you the choice to either keep your share entitlement or to take cash by selling the shares under contract through an entity set up by the company ('share sale facility').\n\nIf it is an Australian insurance company and you chose to keep the shares, you will not be subject to CGT until you eventually sell them or another CGT event happens. However, if you elect to sell your share entitlement through a share sale facility and take cash, you need to include any capital gain in your tax return in the income year in which you entered into the contract to sell the shares, even though you may not receive the cash until a later income year.\n\nThe demutualising company will write to all potential 'shareholders' and advise them of the acquisition cost in each instance, sometimes referred to as the 'embedded value'. Even though you didn't pay anything to acquire the shares, they have a value that is used as the\n[cost base](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATWHATISTHECOSTBASE%22&PiT=99991231235958#WHATISTHECOSTBASE)\nand reduced cost base for CGT purposes.\n\nIf you sell your shares before the insurance company is listed on the stock exchange and you make a capital loss, you disregard the loss.\n\nIf you hold a policy in an overseas insurance company that demutualises, you may be subject to CGT at the time of the demutualisation.\n[Contact us](https://www.ato.gov.au/about-ato/contact-us/)\nfor advice if this applies to you.\n\n**Demutualisation of private health insurers**\n\nIf you hold or held a policy of a private health insurer that converts from a not for profit insurer to a profit insurer by demutualising, you disregard capital gains and losses you make from a CGT event happening to your interest or other right you have or had in the insurer.\n\nIf you receive shares or rights to acquire shares as a result of the demutualisation of your private health insurer you will be taken for CGT purposes to have acquired each share or right at the time it is issued. The first element of the cost base or reduced cost base is equal to the market value of that share or right on the day they are issued.\n\nAny sale of the shares or rights will be a CGT event that may give rise to a capital gain or capital loss in the income year in which you enter into the contract of sale. This includes when the shares are sold through the sale facility.\n\nIf you receive a cash payment under the demutualisation that is not as a result of the sale of the shares or rights you will not make a capital gain or loss.\n\n**Demutualisation of friendly societies**\n\nIf you hold or held a policy of a friendly society that demutualised from a not-for-profit friendly society to a profit friendly society, you may be able to disregard your capital gain or loss from the CGT event. You can disregard capital gains and losses you make from a CGT event happening to your interest or other right you have or had in the friendly society except where you receive an amount of money. Your friendly society should advise you whether you realised a capital gain or capital loss.\n\nIf you received only shares, or rights to acquire shares, as a result of the demutualisation of your friendly society, we consider for CGT purposes that you acquired each share or right at the time it was issued.\n\nYour friendly society should advise you of the cost base of the shares or rights to acquire shares. The cost base, or reduced cost base, will be a proportion of the total of the:\n\n\n\u2022market value of the health insurance business and\n\u2022embedded value of the life insurance business and any other business of the friendly society.\n\n\n\n\nSelling the shares or rights (through the sale facility or otherwise) will be a CGT event that may give rise to a capital gain or capital loss in the income year in which you enter into the contract of sale.\n\n**Share buy-backs**\n\nAs a shareholder, you may have received an offer from a company to buy back some or all of your shares in the company. If you disposed of shares back to the company under a share buy-back arrangement, you may have made a capital gain or capital loss from that CGT event.\n\nYou compare the capital proceeds with your cost base and reduced cost base to work out whether you have made a capital gain or capital loss.\n\nThe time you make the capital gain or capital loss will depend on the conditions of the particular buy-back offer. It may be the time you lodge your application to participate in the buy-back or, if it is a conditional offer of buy-back, the time you accept the offer.\n\nFor an off-market share buy-back announced and undertaken by a listed public company after 7:30 pm (AEDT) 25 October 2022, no part of the buy-back price will be treated as a dividend. Instead, the entire buy-back price is treated as capital proceeds. For more information, see\n[Improving the integrity of off-market share buy-backs](https://www.ato.gov.au/General/New-legislation/In-detail/Direct-taxes/Improving-the-integrity-of-off-market-share-buybacks/)\n.\n\nUnder other off-market buy-backs, where a dividend is paid as part of the buy-back price, the amount paid excluding the dividend is generally your capital proceeds for the share.\n\n**Example 23: buy-back**\n> Sam bought 4,500 shares in Company A in January 1994 at a cost of $5 per share. In February 2024, Sam applied to participate in a buy-back offer to dispose of 675 shares (15%). Company A approved a buy-back of 10% (450) of the shares on 15 June 2024. The company sent Sam a cheque on 5 July 2024 for $4,050 (450 shares \u00d7 $9). No part of the payment is a dividend.\n\n> Sam works out his capital gain for 2023\u201324 as follows:\n\n> 1. If he chooses to use the indexation method:\n> \n> \n> -capital proceeds of $4,050\n> -cost base 450 shares \u00d7 $5 $2,250 \u00d7 1.117 including indexation = $2,513\n> -capital gain is\n> **$1,537.**\n\n> 2. If he chooses to use the discount method:\n> \n> \n> -capital proceeds of $4,050\n> -cost base of $2,250\n> -capital gain (before applying any discount) is\n> **$1,800.**\n\n> Sam has no capital losses to apply against this capital gain and decides that the discount method will provide him with the better result. He takes $900 ($1,800 \u00d7 50%) into account in working out his net capital gain for the year.\n\n\n\n**Example 24: off-market buy-back of shares held in a private company including dividend**\n> Ranjini bought 10,000 shares in Company M, a private company, in January 2004 at a cost of $6 per share, including brokerage. The shares in Company M are not listed on a stock exchange.\n\n> In January 2024, the company wrote to its shareholders advising them it was offering to buy back 10% of their shares for $9.60 each. The buy-back price was to include a franked dividend of $1.40 per share (and each dividend was to carry a franking credit of $0.60).\n\n> Ranjini applied to participate in the buy-back to sell 1,000 of her shares.\n\n> Company M approved the buy-back on 1 May 2024 on the terms anticipated in its earlier letter to shareholders.\n\n> The market value of Company M shares at the time of the buy-back (if the buy-back did not occur and was never proposed) was $10.20.\n\n> Ranjini received a cheque for $9,600 (1,000 shares \u00d7 $9.60) on 8 June 2024.\n\n> Because it was an off-market share buy-back, the shares were not held in a listed public company, and the buy-back price was less than what the market value of the share would have been if the buy-back hadn't occurred. Ranjini works out her capital gain for the 2023\u201324 year as follows.\n\n> **Capital proceeds:**\n\n> Market value ($10.20)\n> **less**\n> dividend ($1.40) = $8.80\n>   \n> \n> $8.80 \u00d7 1,000 shares = $8,800\n>   \n> \n> Cost base: $6 \u00d7 1,000 shares = $6,000\n>   \n> \n> **Capital gain (before applying any discount) = $2,800**\n\n> Ranjini takes her capital gain into account when completing question\n> **18**\n> in her supplementary tax return. She also includes her dividend at question\n> **11**\n> in her tax return ($1,400 at label\n> **T**\n> and $600 at label\n> **U).**\n\n\n\n\n\n**Shares in a company in liquidation or administration**\n\nIf a company is placed in liquidation or administration, company law restricts the transfer of shares in the company. This means that, in the absence of special CGT rules, you may not be able to realise a capital loss on shares that have become worthless unless you declare a trust over them.\n\nIn certain circumstances, you can choose to realise a capital loss on worthless shares before dissolution (if you acquired the shares on or after 20 September 1985). This applies if you own shares in a company and a liquidator or administrator declares in writing that there is no likelihood you will receive any further distribution in the course of winding up the company. A liquidator's declaration can be made after you receive a distribution during the winding up.\n\nFinancial instruments relating to a company (not just shares) can also be declared worthless by a liquidator or administrator.\n\nFinancial instruments include (but are not limited to) convertible notes, debentures, bonds, promissory notes, loans to the company, futures contracts, forward contracts and currency swap contracts relating to the company, and rights or options to acquire any of these (including rights or options to acquire shares in a company). Many financial instruments may be referred to as securities.\n\nIf you make this choice, you will make a capital loss equal to the reduced cost base of the shares (or financial instruments) at the time of the liquidator's or administrator's declaration. The cost base and reduced cost base of the shares (or financial instruments) are reduced to nil just after the liquidator or administrator makes the declaration. This cost base or reduced cost base will be used for the purposes of working out any capital gain or loss you may make from a future CGT event in relation to those shares (or financial instruments).\n\nThese rules don't apply to:\n\n\n\u2022shares or financial instruments you acquired before 20 September 1985\n\u2022a financial instrument where any profit made on the disposal or redemption of it would be included in your assessable income or any loss would be deductible, such as a traditional security or qualifying security\n\u2022shares that are revenue assets at the time when the declaration is made\n\u2022a right acquired prior to 1 July 2009 under an employee share scheme\n\u2022an ESS interest or an ESS interest that is a beneficial interest in a right that is forfeited and is taken to have been acquired, or\n\u2022units in unit trusts or financial instruments relating to trusts.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, see:\n\n\n\u2022[Investments in a company in liquidation or administration](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/capital-gains-tax/shares-and-similar-investments/investments-in-a-company-in-liquidation-or-administration)\n\u2022[Employee share schemes](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/corporate-tax-measures-and-assurance/employee-share-schemes)\n\n\n**Example 25: liquidator's declaration that shares are worthless**\n> The administrators of XYZ Company Ltd made a written declaration on 31 March 2024 that they had reasonable grounds to believe that there was no likelihood that the shareholders of XYZ Company Ltd would receive any distribution from their shares.\n\n> Hillary purchased shares in XYZ Company Ltd in March 2009 for $1.70, including brokerage. Following the administrators' declaration, Hillary can choose to make capital losses equal to the reduced cost bases of her shares as at 31 March 2024. She claims the capital losses in her 2024 tax return.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf no declaration is made by a liquidator or administrator, or you have not chosen to make a capital loss following a declaration by a liquidator or administrator, you may make a capital loss on your shares or financial instruments when a court order is given to dissolve the company.\n\nFor information on when and how you make a choice, see\n[Choices](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCHOICES%22&PiT=99991231235958#CHOICES)\n.\n\nAlso, if a company is wound up voluntarily, shareholders may realise a capital loss either 3 months after a liquidator lodges a tax return showing that the final meeting of the company has been held, or on another date declared by a court. The cancellation of shares as a result of the dissolution of the company is an example of\n[CGT event C2](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATTABLEENDOFCGTASSET%22&PiT=99991231235958#TABLEENDOFCGTASSET)\n.\n\n**Takeovers and mergers**\n\nIf a company in which you own shares is taken over or merges with another company, you may have a CGT obligation if you are required to dispose of your existing shares or they are cancelled.\n\nIn certain circumstances, if you acquire new shares in the takeover or merged company, you may be able to\n[defer paying CGT](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATSCRIPFORSCRIPROLLOVER%22&PiT=99991231235958#SCRIPFORSCRIPROLLOVER)\nuntil a later CGT event happens.\n\nSome takeover or merger arrangements involve an exchange of shares. In these cases, when you calculate your capital gain or capital loss, your capital proceeds will be the market value of the shares received in the takeover or merged company at the time of disposal of your original shares.\n\nIf you receive a combination of money and shares in the takeover or merged company, your capital proceeds are the total of the money and the market value of the shares you received at the time of disposal of the original shares.\n\nThe cost of acquiring the shares in the takeover or merged company is the market value of your original shares at the time you acquire the other shares, reduced by any cash proceeds.\n\nTo correctly calculate the capital gain or capital loss for your original shares, you will need to keep records (in addition to the usual records) showing the parties to the arrangement, the conditions of the arrangement and the capital proceeds.\n\nAs each takeover or merger arrangement will vary according to its own particular circumstances, you need to get full details of the arrangement from the parties involved.\n\nWe are assuming in the following example that the scrip for scrip rollover does not apply.\n\n**Example 26: takeover**\n> In October 2001, Desiree bought 500 shares in DEF Ltd. These shares are currently worth $2 each. Their cost base is $1.50.\n\n> XYZ Ltd offers to acquire each share in DEF Ltd for one share in XYZ Ltd and 75 cents cash. The shares in XYZ Ltd are valued at $1.25 each. Accepting the offer, Desiree receives 500 shares in XYZ Ltd and $375 cash.\n\n> The capital proceeds received for each share in DEF Ltd is $2 ($1.25 market value of each XYZ Ltd share plus 75 cents cash). Therefore, as the cost base of each DEF Ltd share is $1.50, Desiree will make a capital gain of 50 cents ($2 - $1.50) on each share, a total of $250.\n\n> The cost base of the newly acquired XYZ Ltd shares is the market value of the shares in DEF Ltd ($2) less the cash amount received ($0.75) which equals $1.25 each or a total of $625 (500 \u00d7 $1.25).\n\n\n\n\n\n**Scrip for scrip rollover**\n\nIf a company in which you owned shares was taken over and you received new shares in the takeover company, you may be entitled to a scrip for scrip rollover. You may also be eligible for this rollover if you exchange a unit or other interest in a fixed trust, for a similar interest in another fixed trust.\n\nA scrip for scrip rollover is not available if a share is exchanged for a unit or other interest in a fixed trust, or if a unit or other interest in a fixed trust is exchanged for a share.\n\nYou can only choose the rollover if you have made a capital gain from such an exchange on or after 10 December 1999. A rollover does not apply to a capital loss.\n\nA rollover is only available if the exchange is in consequence of an arrangement that results in the acquiring entity (or the wholly owned group of which it is a member) becoming the owner of 80% or more of the original company or trust.\n\nFor companies, the arrangement may qualify for the scrip for scrip rollover if:\n\n\n\u2022holders of voting interests in the target entity can participate in the merger or takeover on substantially the same terms\n\u2022it includes a takeover bid that does not contravene key provisions in Chapter 6 of the\n*Corporations Act 2001*\n(Corporations Act), or\n\u2022if the target entity is a company, it includes a scheme of arrangement approved by a court under Part 5.1 of the Corporations Act.\n\n\n\n\nFor trusts, an arrangement may qualify if:\n\n\n\u2022all owners of trust voting interests in the original entity or, where there are no voting interests, all owners of units or other fixed interests can participate, or\n\u2022it includes a takeover bid that does not contravene the Corporations Act.\n\n\n\n\nThere are special rules if a company or trust has a small number of shareholders or beneficiaries and there is a significant or common stakeholder. If the company or trust does not let you know, you will need to seek information from them about whether these conditions have been satisfied.\n\nThe rollover allows you to disregard the capital gain made from the original shares, units or other interest. You are taken to have acquired the replacement shares, units or other interest for the cost base of the original interest.\n\nYou can apply the CGT discount when you dispose of new shares providing the combined period that you owned the original shares and the new shares is at least 12 months. The same applies to units in a trust. Note that you have to deduct any capital losses (including unapplied net capital losses from earlier years) from your capital gains before applying the CGT discount.\n\nYou may only be eligible for a partial rollover if you exchange shares, units or interests for similar interests in another entity (replacement interest) plus something else, usually cash.\n\nThis is because the rollover applies only to the replacement interest. You will need to apportion the cost base of the original interest between the replacement interest and the cash (or other proceeds not eligible for the rollover).\n\nIf your original shares, units or other interests were acquired before 20 September 1985 (pre-CGT), you are not eligible for a scrip for scrip rollover. Instead, you acquire the replacement interest at the time of the exchange and the replacement interest is no longer a pre-CGT asset. However, if the arrangement is one that would otherwise qualify for a scrip for scrip rollover, the cost base of the replacement interest is its market value just after the acquisition.\n\n**Example 27: partial scrip for scrip rollover**\n> Gunther owns 100 shares in Windsor Ltd, each with a cost base of $9. He accepts a takeover offer from Regal Ltd, which provides for Gunther to receive one Regal share plus $10 cash for each share in Windsor. Gunther receives 100 shares in Regal and $1,000 cash. Just after Gunther is issued shares in Regal, each share is worth $20.\n\n> Gunther receives $10 cash for each of his Windsor shares and so has $1,000 to which a rollover does not apply.\n\n> In this case, it is reasonable to allocate a portion of the cost base of the original shares having regard to the proportion that the cash bears to the total proceeds. That is:\n> \n> `A \u00f7 B \u00d7 C = D`\n\n> Where:\n> \n> \n> \u2022A is cash\n> \u2022B is total proceeds (cash and value of shares received)\n> \u2022C is cost base of original share\n> \u2022D is proportion of cost base for which cash was received\n\n> Following on from the formula above, Gunther's calculations are:\n> \n> `$1,000 \u00f7 $3,000 \u00d7 $900 = $300`\n\n> Gunther's capital gain is as follows:\n> \n> `$1,000 (cash) - $300 (cost base) = $700 (capital gain)`\n\n> Gunther calculates the cost base of each of his Regal shares as follows:\n> \n> `($900 - $300) \u00f7 100 = $6`\n\n\n\n**Example 28: scrip for scrip rollover**\n> Stephanie owns ordinary shares in Reef Ltd. On 28 February 2024, she accepted a takeover offer from Starfish Ltd, under which she received one ordinary share and one preference share for each Reef share. The market value of the Starfish shares just after Stephanie acquired them was $20 for each ordinary share and $10 for each preference share.\n\n> The cost base of each Reef share just before Stephanie ceased to own them was $15.\n\n> The offer made by Starfish Ltd satisfied all the requirements for a scrip for scrip rollover.\n\n> If the rollover didn't apply, Stephanie would have made a capital gain per share of:\n> \n> `$30 (capital proceeds) - $15 (cost base) = $15 (capital gain)`\n\n> Scrip for scrip rollover allows Stephanie to disregard the capital gain. The cost base of the Starfish shares is the cost base of the Reef Ltd shares.\n\n> **Apportioning the cost base**\n\n> As the exchange is one share in Reef Ltd for 2 shares in Starfish Ltd, Stephanie needs to apportion the cost base of the Reef Ltd share between the ordinary share and the preference share.\n\n> Cost base of ordinary share:\n> \n> `$20 \u00f7 30 \u00d7 $15 = $10`\n\n> Cost base of preference share:\n> \n> `$10 \u00f7 30 \u00d7 $15 = $5`\n\n\n\n\n\n**Demergers**\n\nA demerger involves the restructuring of a corporate or fixed trust group by splitting its operations into 2 or more entities or groups.\n\nUnder a demerger, the owners of the head entity of the group (that is, the shareholders of the company or unit holders of the trust) acquire a direct interest (shares or units) in an entity that was formerly part of the group (the demerged entity).\n\n**Example 29: demerger**\n> Peter owns shares (his original interest) in Company A. Company B is a wholly owned subsidiary of Company A. Company A undertakes a demerger by transferring all its shares in Company B to its shareholders. Following the demerger, all the shareholders in Company A, including Peter, will own all the shares in Company B (their new interests) in the same proportion that they hold their shares in Company A.\n\n\n\n\n\n***Demergers on or after 1 July 2002***\n\nCertain rules apply to eligible demergers that happened on or after 1 July 2002.\n\n***Demerger rollover***\n\nIf you received new interests in a demerged entity under an eligible demerger that happened on or after 1 July 2002, you need to be aware of the following CGT consequences:\n\n\n\u2022you may be entitled to choose a rollover for any capital gain or capital loss you make under the demerger\n\u2022you must calculate the cost base and reduced cost base of your interests in the head entity and your new interests in the demerged entity immediately after the demerger.\n\n\n\n\nThe head entity will normally advise you whether it has undertaken an eligible demerger. We may have provided advice to the head entity in the form of a class ruling.\n\n***Rollover available***\n\nTo choose a rollover, the demerger must be an eligible demerger.\n\nIf you choose a rollover:\n\n\n\u2022you disregard any capital gain or capital loss made under the demerger, and\n\u2022your new interests in the demerged entity are acquired on the date of the demerger. However, if a proportion of your original interests was acquired before 20 September 1985 (pre-CGT), the same proportion of your new interests in the demerged entity is treated as pre-CGT assets.\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't choose a rollover:\n\n\n\u2022you can't disregard any capital gain or capital loss made under the demerger, and\n\u2022all your new interests in the demerged entity are acquired on the date of the demerger.\n\n\n\n\n***Demerger exemption***\n\nThis exemption applies to disregard certain capital gains or capital losses made by a demerging entity in a demerger group. A demerger group comprises the head entity of a group of companies or trusts and at least one demerger subsidiary. Discretionary trusts and superannuation funds can't be members of a demerger group.\n\n***Cost base calculations***\n\nYou must recalculate the first element of the cost base and reduced cost base of your remaining original interests in the head entity and of your new interests in the demerged entity. You must make these calculations whether you choose a rollover or not, or if no CGT event happens to your original interests under the demerger.\n\nThe calculation will depend on whether you have pre-CGT original interests in the head entity.\n\n***Cost base calculations where you don't have pre-CGT interests***\n\nYou work out the cost base and reduced cost base of your remaining post-CGT original interests and your post-CGT new interests immediately after the demerger. You do this by spreading the total cost base of your post-CGT original interests (immediately before the demerger) over both your remaining post-CGT original interests and your post-CGT new interests. The following steps explain how to do this.\n\nThe steps and\n**example 30**\nwork out new cost bases using a method referred to as the 'relative market value method', which is sometimes also referred to as the 'averaging method'. You may be able to use other methods if they are reasonable.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Demergers CGT rollover for shareholders and unit holders](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/capital-gains-tax/shares-and-similar-investments/demergers-cgt-rollover-for-shareholders-and-unit-holders)\n.\n\n**Step 1**\n\nAdd the cost bases of your post-CGT original interests immediately before the demerger. Don't reduce your total cost base by any capital amounts returned to you under the demerger and don't include indexation.\n\n**Step 2**\n\nUse the relevant percentages to apportion the step 1 amount between:\n\n\n\u2022your post-CGT original interests in the head entity, and\n\u2022your post-CGT new interests in the demerged entity.\n\n\n\n\nThe head entity should generally advise you of the relevant percentages to use.\n\n**Step 3**\n\nDivide the cost base apportioned to the head entity interests (from step 2) by the number of remaining post-CGT original interests you own.\n\n**Step 4**\n\nDivide the cost base apportioned to the demerged entity interests (from step 2) by the number of post-CGT new interests you own.\n\nThese amounts will form the first element of the cost base and reduced cost base of your post-CGT original interests and post-CGT new interests.\n\n**Example 30: no pre-CGT interests**\n> Under the BHP Billiton Ltd demerger of BHP Steel Ltd, shareholders received one BHP Steel share for every 5 BHP Billiton shares they owned at the date of the demerger.\n\n> Anita owned 280 BHP Billiton shares (all post-CGT) with a cost base of $2,500 immediately before the demerger. Under the demerger, Anita received 56 BHP Steel shares. Anita works out the cost base and reduced cost base of her BHP Billiton shares and BHP Steel shares as follows:\n\n> 1. The total cost base of the BHP Billiton shares immediately before the demerger was $2,500.\n\n> 2. BHP Billiton advised shareholders to apportion 94.937% of the total cost base from step 1 to BHP Billiton shares and 5.063% to BHP Steel shares:\n> \n> \n> a.BHP Billiton: 94.937% \u00d7 $2,500= $2,373.43\n> b.BHP Steel: 5.063% \u00d7 $2,500 = $126.58.\n\n> 3. Divide the step 2(a) amount by the 280 BHP Billiton shares:\n> \n> `$2,373.43 \u00f7 280 = $8.48 per share`\n\n> 4. Divide the step 2(b) amount by the 56 BHP Steel shares\n> \n> `$126.58 \u00f7 56 = $2.26 per share.`\n\n\n\n\n\n***Cost base calculations where you have pre-CGT interests***\n\n*If you choose a rollover*\n\nIf you choose a rollover and a proportion of your original interests are pre-CGT, the same proportion of your new interests will be treated as pre-CGT interests. It is not necessary to calculate the cost base and reduced cost base for your pre-CGT interests.\n\nYou calculate the cost base and reduced cost base of your remaining post-CGT original interests and your post-CGT new interests in the same way as shown in the example above.\n\nThere is no change to the acquisition date of your original interests.\n\n*If you don't or can't choose a rollover*\n\nIf you don't or you can't choose a rollover (for example, because a CGT event didn't happen to your original interests), the new interests that you receive for your pre-CGT original interests are treated as post-CGT interests. You work out the cost base of these new interests under the ordinary cost base rules. This will generally be equal to the capital return and dividend distributed from the head entity that is applied to acquire those new interests.\n\nIt may be to your advantage not to choose a rollover for the new interests you receive for your pre-CGT original interests. For example, where the reduced cost bases of those new interests calculated under the ordinary cost base rules mean you will make a capital loss when you dispose of them.\n\nYou calculate the cost base and reduced cost base of your remaining post-CGT original interests and your post-CGT new interests (other than those received for pre-CGT original interests) in the same way as shown in\nexample 30\nexcept that you ignore the new interests received for pre-CGT original interests in the calculation.\n\nThere is no change to the acquisition date of your original interests.\n\n**Example 31: with pre-CGT interests**\n> Anita owned 400 BHP Billiton shares immediately before the demerger:\n> \n> \n> \u2022120 pre-CGT shares\n> \u2022280 post-CGT shares (the cost base of which, immediately before the demerger, was $2,500).\n\n> **Either**\n> Anita chooses a rollover. The 24 BHP Steel shares she received for the 120 pre-CGT BHP Billiton shares are pre-CGT. It is not necessary for Anita to work out the cost base and reduced cost base for her pre-CGT interests.\n\n> Immediately after the demerger, she calculates the cost base and reduced cost base of her 280 post-CGT BHP Billiton shares and the 56 BHP Steel shares she received for those BHP Billiton shares in the same way as shown in\n> example 30\n> .\n\n> **Or**\n> Anita does not choose a rollover. The 24 BHP Steel shares she received for the 120 pre-CGT BHP shares are post-CGT shares acquired on the date of the demerger. Immediately after the demerger, the cost base and reduced cost base of the 24 BHP Steel shares are $3.45 per share (the capital return of $0.69 per share \u00d7 5).\n\n> Immediately after the demerger, she calculates the cost base and reduced cost base of her 280 post-CGT BHP Billiton shares and the 56 BHP Steel shares she received for those BHP Billiton shares in the same way as shown in\n> example 30\n> .\n\n> **In either case**\n> there is no change to the pre-CGT status of Anita's 120 BHP Billiton shares.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Using the discount method if you sell your shares after the demerger*\n\nIf you sell your new interests in the demerged entity after the demerger, you must have owned those interests for at least 12 months from the date you acquired the corresponding original interests in the head entity in order to use the discount method.\n\n**Example 32: using the discount method after a demerger (1)**\n> You received BHP Steel Ltd shares under the demerger on 22 July 2002. They related to shares you acquired in BHP Billiton Ltd on 15 August 2001. You can only use the discount method to work out your capital gain on these shares if you dispose of them after 15 August 2002; that is, more than 12 months after the date you acquired the BHP Billiton shares.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, you calculate the 12 months from the date of demerger if you:\n\n\n\u2022did not choose the rollover and you received new interests in the demerged entity which relate to pre-CGT interests in the head entity, or\n\u2022acquired your new interests without a CGT event happening to your original interests.\n\n\n**Example 33: using the discount method after a demerger (2)**\n> You received BHP Steel Ltd shares under the demerger where you calculated the cost base as $3.45 per share (because they related to pre-CGT shares you owned in BHP Billiton Ltd and you did not choose a rollover). You can only use the discount method to work out your capital gain on these shares if you disposed of them after 22 July 2003; that is, more than 12 months after the demerger.\n\n\n\n\n\n***Demergers calculator and other products and information***\n\nYou can use our\n[Demergers calculator](https://www.ato.gov.au/calculators-and-tools/shares-demergers-calculator)\nto help you make these calculations.\n\nWe also have other products to help you, such as question-and-answer sheets for some demergers undertaken by major listed entities; see\n[Demergers CGT rollover for shareholders and unit holders](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/capital-gains-tax/shares-and-similar-investments/demergers-cgt-rollover-for-shareholders-and-unit-holders)\n.\n\n**Dividend reinvestment plans**\n\nSome companies ask their shareholders whether they would like to participate in a dividend reinvestment plan. Under these plans, shareholders can choose to use their dividend to acquire additional shares in the company instead of receiving a cash payment. These shares are usually issued at a discount on the current market price of the shares in the company.\n\nFor CGT purposes, if you participate in a dividend reinvestment plan you are treated as if you had received a cash dividend and then used the cash to buy additional shares.\n\nEach share (or parcel of shares) acquired in this way, on or after 20 September 1985, is subject to CGT. The cost base of the new shares includes the price you paid to acquire them, that is, the amount of the dividend.\n\n**Example 34: dividend reinvestment plans**\n> Natalie owns 1,440 shares in PHB Ltd. The shares are currently worth $8 each. In November 2023, the company declared a dividend of 25 cents per share.\n\n> Natalie could either take the $360 dividend as cash (1,440 \u00d7 25 cents) or receive 45 additional shares in the company (360 \u00f7 8).\n\n> Natalie decided to participate in the dividend reinvestment plan and received 45 new shares on 20 December 2023.

If you dispose of bonus shares received on or after 20 September 1985, you may make a capital gain. You may also have to modify the cost base and reduced cost base of your existing shares in the company if you receive bonus shares.\n\nThe cost base and reduced cost base of bonus shares depend on whether the bonus shares are assessable as a dividend.\n\nAs a result of changes to company and taxation laws, the paid-up value of bonus shares is now generally not assessable as a dividend. An exception to this rule is where you have the choice of being paid a cash dividend or of being issued shares under a dividend reinvestment plan. These shares are treated as dividends and the amount of the dividend is included in your assessable income.\n\n\n\n\n*Table 3 explains how the time of issue of your bonus shares affects whether the paid-up value of the bonus shares is assessed as a dividend.*\n  \n\n| Date | Implications of timing of bonus shares |\n| From 20 September 1985 to 30 June 1987 inclusive | Many bonus shares issued were paid out of a company's asset revaluation reserve or from a share premium account. These bonus shares are not usually assessable dividends. |\n| From 1 July 1987 to 30 June 1998 inclusive | The paid-up value of bonus shares issued is assessed as a dividend unless paid from a share premium account. |\n| From 1 July 1998 | The paid-up value of bonus shares issued is generally not assessed as a dividend unless you have the choice of being paid a dividend or being issued shares and you chose to be issued with shares. |\n\n\n\nThere are other, less common, circumstances where bonus shares will be assessed as a dividend, for example, where:\n\n\n\u2022the bonus shares are being substituted for a dividend to give a tax advantage\n\u2022the company directs bonus shares to some shareholders and dividends to others to give them a tax benefit.\n\n\n\n\n[Flowchart 3.1](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATFLOWCHART3.1%22&PiT=99991231235958#FLOWCHART3.1)\nin\n**appendix 3**\nsummarises the different rules applying to different bonus shares issued on or after 20 September 1985.\n\n***Bonus shares issued where no amount is assessed as a dividend***\n\nThis will depend on when the shares were acquired.\n\n*Original shares acquired on or after 20 September 1985*\n\nIf your bonus shares relate to other shares that you acquired on or after 20 September 1985 (referred to as your original shares) your bonus shares are taken to have been acquired on the date you acquired your original shares. If you acquired your original shares at different times, you will have to work out how many of your bonus shares are taken to have been acquired at each of those times.\n\nCalculate the cost base and reduced cost base of the bonus shares by apportioning the cost base and reduced cost base of the original shares over both the original and the bonus shares. Effectively, this results in a reduction of the cost base and reduced cost base of the original shares. You also include any calls paid on partly paid bonus shares as part of the cost base and reduced cost base that is apportioned between the original and the bonus shares.\n\n*Original shares acquired before 20 September 1985*\n\nYour CGT obligations depend on when the bonus shares were issued and whether they are fully paid or partly paid.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Flowchart 3.1](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATFLOWCHART3.1%22&PiT=99991231235958#FLOWCHART3.1)\nin\n**Appendix 3.**\n\n**Example 35: fully paid bonus shares**\n> Chris bought 100 shares in MAC Ltd for $1 each on 1 June 1985. He bought 300 more shares for $1 each on 27 May 1986. On 15 November 1986, MAC Ltd issued Chris with 400 bonus shares from its capital profits reserve, fully paid to $1. Chris didn't pay anything to acquire the bonus shares and no part of the value of the bonus shares was assessed as a dividend.\n\n> For CGT purposes, the acquisition date of 100 of the bonus shares is 1 June 1985 (pre-CGT). Therefore, those bonus shares are not subject to CGT.\n\n> The acquisition date of the other 300 bonus shares is 27 May 1986. Their cost base is worked out by spreading the cost of the 300 shares Chris bought on that date over both those original shares and the remaining 300 bonus shares. As the 300 original shares cost $300, the cost base of each share will now be 50 cents.\n\n\n\n**Example 36: partly paid bonus shares**\n> Klaus owns 200 shares in MAC Ltd, which he bought on 31 October 1984, and 200 shares in PUP Ltd, which he bought on 31 January 1985.\n\n> On 1 January 1987, both MAC Ltd and PUP Ltd made their shareholders a one-for-one bonus share offer of $1 shares partly paid to 50 cents. Klaus elected to accept the offer and acquired 200 new partly paid shares in each company. No part of the value of the bonus shares was taxed as a dividend.\n\n> On 1 April 1989, PUP Ltd made a call for the balance of 50 cents outstanding on the partly paid shares, payable on 30 June 1989. Klaus paid the call payment on that date. MAC Ltd has not yet made any calls on its partly paid shares.\n\n> For CGT purposes, Klaus is treated as having acquired his bonus PUP Ltd shares on the date he became liable to pay the call (1 April 1989). The cost base of the bonus shares in PUP Ltd includes the amount of the call payment (50 cents) plus the market value of the shares immediately before the call was made.\n\n> The MAC Ltd bonus shares will continue to have the same acquisition date as the original shares (31 October 1984) and are therefore not subject to CGT. However, this will not be the case if Klaus makes any more payments to the company on calls made by the company for any part of the unpaid amount on the bonus shares. In this case, the acquisition date of the bonus shares will be when the liability to pay the call arises and the bonus shares will then be subject to CGT.\n\n\n\n\n\n***Bonus shares issued where the paid-up value is assessed as a dividend***\n\nIf the paid-up value of bonus shares is assessed as a dividend, you may have to pay CGT when you dispose of the bonus shares, regardless of when you acquired the original shares.\n\n*Original shares acquired on or after 20 September 1985*\n\nIf your bonus shares relate to original shares that you acquired on or after 20 September 1985, the acquisition date of the bonus shares is the date they were issued.

Shanti therefore received 500 rights in total. At that time, shares in ZAC Ltd were worth $2. Each right was therefore worth 20 cents.\n\n> Shanti decided that she did not wish to buy any more shares in ZAC Ltd, so she sold all her rights for 20 cents each, a total amount of $100. Only those rights issued for the shares she bought on 1 December 1996 are subject to CGT. As Shanti did not pay anything for the rights, she has made a $50 taxable capital gain on their sale.\n\n> The $50 Shanti received on the sale of her rights for the shares she bought on 1 June 1985 is not subject to CGT, as those rights are taken to have been acquired at the same time as the shares, that is, before 20 September 1985.\n\n\n\n**Example 40: rights exercised**\n> Assume that, in\n> **example 39,**\n> Shanti wished to acquire more shares in ZAC Ltd. She therefore exercised all 500 rights on 1 August 1998 when they were still worth 20 cents each.\n\n> There are no CGT consequences arising from the exercise of the rights.\n\n> However, the 500 shares Shanti acquired on 1 August 1998 when she exercised the rights are subject to CGT and are acquired at the time of the exercise.\n> \n> \n> \u2022When Shanti exercised the rights issued for the shares she bought on 1 December 1996, the cost base of the 250 shares she acquired is the amount she paid to exercise each right ($1.80 for each share).\n> \u2022When Shanti exercised the rights for the shares she bought before 20 September 1985, Shanti's cost base for each of the 250 shares she acquired includes not only the exercise price of the right ($1.80) but also the market value of the right at that time (20 cents). The cost base of each share is therefore $2.\n\n\n\n\n\n***CGT discount on shares or units acquired from exercise of rights or options***\n\nYou can use the discount method to calculate your capital gain from an asset only if you own it for at least 12 months. In calculating any capital gain on shares or units you acquire from the exercise of a right or option, the 12-month period applies from the date you acquire the shares or units (not the date you acquired the right or option).\n\n**Retail premiums**\n\nSome or all of a payment may be a retail premium if you receive it because:\n\n\n\u2022you did not exercise some or all of your right or entitlement, either by choice or otherwise\n\u2022you were not eligible to exercise some or all of your right or entitlement, or\n\u2022you did not receive some or all of your right or entitlement.\n\n\n\n\nYou receive a retail premium if:\n\n\n\u2022you own shares in a company which offers shareholders a right or entitlement to subscribe for additional shares in proportion to their existing shareholding at a set amount, often called 'the offer price'\n\u2022you don't participate; that is, one of the following applies\n\n\n-you choose not to take up some or all of your right or entitlement\n-you are ineligible to receive some or all of a right or entitlement\n-you are not permitted to take up some or all of your right or entitlement\n\n\n\n\u2022the company that issued the right or entitlement arranges to issue a number of shares, equivalent to those which would have been issued to you had you exercised the right or entitlement for which you did not participate, to other subscribers such as institutional investors \u2013 the amount offered by the subscribers for the equivalent shares is often called 'the clearing price'\n\u2022the clearing price is the basis of a payment to you, generally because it is more than the offer price.\n\n\n\n\nThe retail premium will be the amount paid to you, generally worked out on a pro rata basis by the company because you are a shareholder or unit holder and you don't participate. The retail premium the company pays will generally be a share of all or part of the difference between the clearing price of the shares and the offer price.\n\nA retail premium payment you receive is taxed in different ways, depending on whether it is renounceable or non-renounceable.\n\nIf it is a renounceable right, the retail premium will constitute a capital gain.\n\nFor non-renounceable rights, retail premiums are unfranked dividends, or alternatively ordinary income, and should not be treated as capital gains. Shareholders who receive the premiums are not eligible to claim the CGT discount.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Taxing retail premiums](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/investing-in-shares/owning-shares/taxing-retail-premiums)\n.\n\n**Convertible notes**\n\nA convertible note (which is one type of convertible interest) is another type of investment you can make in a company or unit trust. A convertible note earns interest on the amount you pay to acquire the note until the note's expiry date. On expiry of the note, you can either ask for the return of the money paid or convert the note to new shares or units.\n\nConvertible notes you acquired after 10 May 1989 will generally not be subject to CGT if you sold or disposed of them before they were converted into shares.

When you phone, have the date you acquired the convertible note as this may affect the tax treatment.\n\n***Conversion of notes to shares***\n\nThe tax treatment that applies when your convertible notes are converted to shares depends on:\n\n\n\u2022when you acquired the convertible notes\n\u2022the type of convertible note\n\u2022when the conversion occurred, and\n\u2022when the convertible note was issued.\n\n\n\n\nShares acquired by the conversion of convertible notes on or after 20 September 1985 will be subject to CGT when they are sold or disposed of, as the shares are taken to be acquired when the conversion happens.\n\nYou may have acquired the convertible notes on or after 20 September 1985 and, as a traditional security or qualifying security, you have already included the gain you made on the conversion of the notes in your tax return as income (or as a deduction if you made a loss). The way you calculate the cost base of the shares varies depending on whether the notes converted to shares before 1 July 2001 or on or after that date.\n[Table 4](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATTABLE4%22&PiT=99991231235958#TABLE4)\nprovides a summary.\n\n***Convertible notes issued after 14 May 2002***\n\nIf your convertible notes are traditional securities and were issued by a company after 14 May 2002:\n\n\n\u2022any gains you make when these notes are converted or exchanged for ordinary shares in a company will not be ordinary income at the time of conversion or exchange, and any losses you make will not be deductible\n\u2022instead, any gains or losses you make on the later sale or disposal of the shares (incorporating any gain or loss that would have been made on the conversion or exchange of the notes) will be either\n\n\n-subject to CGT if you are an ordinary investor\n-ordinary income (or deductible, in the case of a loss) if you are in the business of trading in shares and other securities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are an individual who is an ordinary investor, this means you will be able to get the benefit of the CGT discount if you own the shares for more than 12 months.\n\n\n**Table 4**\nsets out how you calculate the cost base.\n\n\n*Table 4: Treatment of convertible notes acquired after 10 May 1989, converted to shares*\n  \n\n| Convertible note | Converted before 1 July 2001 | Converted on or after 1 July 2001 |\n| The note is a traditional security (see note 1) that was issued before 15 May 2002. | You include gain on conversion as income (or loss on conversion is deducted). Cost base of shares includes their market value at the date the convertible notes were converted. | You include gain on conversion as income (or loss on conversion is deducted). Cost base of shares includes cost base of the convertible note, any amount paid on conversion and any amount included in your assessable income on conversion. |\n| The note is a traditional security (see note 1) that was issued after 14 May 2002. | Not applicable. | You disregard gain (or loss) on conversion. Cost base of shares includes cost base of the convertible note and any amount paid on conversion. |\n| The note is a qualifying security (see note 2). | You include accrued gains as income and include any gain on conversion as income (or deduct any loss on conversion). Cost base of shares includes amounts paid to acquire the note and any amount paid on conversion. | You include accrued gains as income and include any gain on conversion as income (or deduct any loss on conversion). Cost base of shares includes cost base of the convertible note, any amount paid on conversion and any amount included in your assessable income on conversion. |\n\n\n\n**Note 1:**\nA traditional security is one that is not issued at a discount of more than 1.5%, does not bear deferred interest and is not capital indexed. It may be, for example, a bond, a deposit with a financial institution, or a secured or unsecured loan.\n\n**Note 2:**\nA qualifying security is one that has a deferred income element, that is, it is issued under terms such that the investor's return on investment (other than periodic interest) will be greater than 1.5% per annum.\n\n***Conversion of notes to units***\n\nThis will depend on when the conversion of notes to units occurred.\n\n*Convertible notes, converted before 1 July 2001*\n\nIf your convertible notes are traditional securities, the first element of the cost base and reduced cost base of the units is their market value at the time of conversion. You disregard any capital gain or capital loss made on their conversion to units in the unit trust.\n\nIf your convertible notes are not traditional securities and were issued by the unit trust after 28 January 1988, the first element of the cost base and reduced cost base of the units includes both the cost of the convertible notes and any further amount payable on their conversion. You disregard any capital gain or capital loss made on their conversion to units in the unit trust.\n\n*Convertible notes, converted on or after 1 July 2001*\n\nIf your convertible notes are traditional securities the first element of the cost base and reduced cost base of the units includes:\n\n\n\u2022the cost base of the convertible notes, plus\n\u2022any amount paid on conversion, plus\n\u2022any amount included in your assessable income on conversion.\n\n\n\n\nYou disregard any capital gain or capital loss made on their conversion to units in the unit trust.\n\nSimilarly, if the convertible notes are not traditional securities and were issued by the unit trust after 28 January 1988, the first element of the cost base and reduced cost base of the units includes:\n\n\n\u2022the cost base of the convertible notes, plus\n\u2022any amount paid on conversion, plus\n\u2022any amount included in your assessable income on conversion.\n\n\n\n\nYou disregard any capital gain or capital loss made on their conversion to units in the unit trust.\n\n**Example 41: converting notes to shares**\n> David bought 1,000 convertible notes in DCS Ltd on 1 July 1997 (that is, notes that were issued before 15 May 2002). The notes cost $5 each. Each convertible note is convertible into one DCS Ltd share. On expiry of the notes on 1 July 2000, shares in the company were worth $7 each. David converted the notes to shares, which are subject to CGT. No further amount was payable on conversion of the notes. David sold the shares on 4 December 2023 for $10 each.\n\n> The $2 ($7 - $5) gain David made on the conversion of each of the notes to shares was assessable to David as ordinary income at the time of conversion, that is, in 2000-01. As such, David has no capital gain in that year.\n\n> The $3 ($10 - $7) gain David made on the sale of each of the shares is subject to CGT. The $7 cost base is the market value per share on the date the notes converted to shares. Because he sold the shares after 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999 and owned them for at least 12 months, David can claim the CGT discount. David calculates his capital gain as follows:\n> \n> `$3 per share \u00d7 1,000 shares = $3,000\n>   \n> subtract\n> CGT discount of 50% = $1,500`\n\n> **Net capital gain = $1,500**\n\n> David includes the capital gain on his 2024 tax return.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Stapled securities**\n\nStapled securities are created when 2 or more different securities are legally bound together so that they can't be sold separately. Many different types of securities can be stapled together. For example, many property trusts have their units stapled to the shares of companies with which they are closely associated.\n\nThe effect of stapling depends on the specific terms of the stapling arrangement. The issuer of the stapled security will be able to provide you with detailed information on their particular stapling arrangement. However, in general, the effect of stapling is that each individual security retains its character and there is no variation to the rights or obligations attaching to the individual securities.\n\nAlthough a stapled security must be dealt with as a whole, the individual securities that are stapled are treated separately for tax purposes. For example, if a share in a company and a unit in a unit trust are stapled, you:\n\n\n\u2022continue to include separately in your tax return dividends from the company and trust distributions from the trust\n\u2022work out any capital gain or capital loss separately for the unit and the share.\n\n\n\n\nBecause each security that makes up your stapled security is a separate CGT asset, you must work out a cost base and reduced cost base for each separately.\n\nIf you acquired the securities after they were stapled (for example, you bought the stapled securities on the ASX), you do this by apportioning, on a reasonable basis, the amount you paid to acquire the stapled security (and any other relevant costs) between the various securities that are stapled. One reasonable basis of apportionment is to have regard to the portion of the value of the stapled security that each security represented. The issuer of the stapled security may provide assistance in determining these amounts.\n\n**Example 42: apportionment of cost base and reduced cost base to the separate securities**\n> On 1 September 2003, Cathy acquired 100 JKL stapled securities, which comprised a share in JKL Ltd and a unit in the JKL Unit Trust. She paid $4.00 for each stapled security, and on the basis of the information provided to her by the issuer of the stapled securities, she determined that 60% of the amount paid was attributable to the value of the share and 40% to the value of the unit. On this basis, the first element of the cost base and reduced cost base of each of Cathy's shares in JKL Ltd will be $2.40 ($4.00 \u00d7 60%). The first element of the cost base and reduced cost base of each of Cathy's units in JKL Unit Trust will be $1.60 ($4.00 \u00d7 40%).\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you acquired your stapled securities as part of a corporate restructure you will, during the restructure, have owned individual securities that were not stapled. The way you work out the cost base and reduced cost base of each security depends on the terms of the stapling arrangement.\n\nThe stapling does not result in any CGT consequences for you, because the individual securities are always treated as separate securities. However, there may be other aspects of the whole restructure arrangement which will result in CGT consequences for you.\n\n**Example 43: CGT consequences associated with the stapling of securities**\n> Jamie acquired 100 units in the Westfield America Trust (WFA) in January 2003. Immediately before the merger of Westfield America Trust with Westfield Holdings Ltd and Westfield Trust (July 2004), the cost base of each of his units was $2.12 (total cost base = $212 ($2.12 \u00d7 100)).\n\n> Under the arrangement, Jamie's original units in WFA were firstly consolidated in the ratio of 0.15 consolidated WFA unit for each original WFA unit. After the consolidation, Jamie held 15 consolidated WFA units with a cost base of $14.13 ($212 \u00f7 15) each. There were no CGT consequences for Jamie as a result of the consolidation of his units in WFA.\n\n> Jamie then received a capital distribution of $1.01 for each consolidated unit he held.\n\n> CGT event E4 happens as a result of the capital distribution, see\n> [Appendix 1](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATA1%22&PiT=99991231235958#A1)\n> . Consequently, Jamie must reduce the cost base of each of his consolidated WFA units by $1.01 to $13.12.\n\n> The capital distribution was compulsorily applied to acquire a share in Westfield Holdings Ltd (WSF) for $0.01 and a unit in the Westfield Trust (WFT) for $1.00. The first element of the cost base and reduced cost base of each of Jamie's new shares in WSF will be $0.01 and, for each new WFT unit, $1.00.\n\n> The units and shares were then stapled to form a Westfield Group Security. There were no CGT consequences for Jamie as a result of the stapling of each consolidated WFA unit to each new WFT unit and WSF share.\n\n> Following the arrangement, Jamie holds 15 Westfield Group Securities with the following CGT attributes:\n> \n> \n> \u2022\n> **Element:**\n> Cost base (initial)\n> \u2022\n> **WFA unit:**\n> $13.12\n> \u2022\n> **WFT unit:**\n> $1.00\n> \u2022\n> **WSF share:**\n> $0.01\n> \u2022\n> **Total:**\n> $14.13\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you dispose of your stapled securities, you must:\n\n\n\u2022divide the capital proceeds (on a reasonable basis) between the securities that make up the stapled security\n\u2022then work out whether you have made a capital gain or capital loss on each security.\n\n\n\n\nOther tax provisions may apply upon disposal of some securities. For example, you include a gain made on a traditional security in your assessable income under other tax provisions.\n\n**Example 44: apportioning the capital proceeds between the separate securities**\n> On 1 August 1984, Kelley purchased 100 shares in XYZ Ltd for $4.00 per share. In August 2003, Kelley was allocated 100 units in XYZ Unit Trust under a corporate reorganisation of the XYZ Group. The units were acquired for $1.00 each, with the funds to acquire the units coming from a capital reduction made in respect of her shares. At that same time, Kelley's shares in XYZ Ltd and units in XYZ Unit Trust were stapled and became known as XYZ stapled securities.\n\n> Kelley disposed of all of her XYZ stapled securities on 1 March 2024 for $8.00 per security. On the basis of the information provided by the issuer of the stapled securities, Kelley determined that of this amount, 70% or $5.60 per share ($8.00 \u00d7 70%) was attributable to the value of her XYZ Ltd shares, and 30% or $2.40 per unit ($8.00 \u00d7 30%) was attributable to the value of her units in the XYZ Unit Trust.\n\n> Kelley must account for the sale of each share and unit (that make up the stapled security) separately.\n\n> As Kelley acquired her XYZ Ltd shares before 20 September 1985, she disregards any capital gain or capital loss she makes on the disposal of these shares.\n\n> Kelley will make a capital gain of $1.40 per unit ($2.40 - $1.00) on the disposal of her units in the XYZ Unit Trust. As Kelley owned those units for more than 12 months, she can reduce her capital gain by the CGT discount of 50% after applying any capital losses.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Employee share schemes**\n\n[Employee share schemes](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/corporate-tax-measures-and-assurance/employee-share-schemes)\n(ESS) give employees benefits such as shares or the opportunity to buy shares or rights (including options) in the company they work for at a discounted price. These benefits are known as ESS interests. In most cases, ESS interests are exempt from CGT implications until the discount on the ESS interest has been taxed. When you sell your ESS interests (or resulting shares), they are taxed under the CGT rules (or if you are a share trader, the trading stock rules).\n\n***CGT implications for employee shares and rights under a corporate restructure***\n\nIf employee shares or rights are exchanged for replacement shares or rights in a new company under a corporate restructure that happened on or after 1 July 2004, a rollover may be available so that there is no taxing point under the ESS tax rules. Corporate restructures affected include mergers, demergers (in limited circumstances) and 100% takeovers. Any capital gain or capital loss made on the employee shares or rights because of the restructure will be disregarded where this rollover applies. For more information, see\n[ESS \u2013 Rollover relief](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/corporate-tax-measures-and-assurance/employee-share-schemes/in-detail/ess-rollover-relief)\n.\n\n***Changing residence or working in multiple countries***\n\nThere are specific CGT rules relating to ESS shares or rights held by employees who become, or cease to be, Australian residents. There are also specific rules for temporary residents.\n\n**Shares in an early stage innovation company**\n\nModified CGT treatment applies to your shares in an ESIC, depending on how long you hold the shares before a CGT event happens to them (such as the sale of the shares) and whether you make a capital gain or capital loss from the CGT event.\n\nHowever, if you invest more than $50,000 in ESICs in an income year and don't meet the sophisticated investor requirements, you will not be eligible for modified CGT treatment on any of the shares acquired in that income year.\n\n\n*The general rules for modified CGT treatment are summarised below:*\n  \n\n| Shares held for | Modified CGT treatment |\n| Less than 12 months | Any capital gain you make from a CGT event is not disregarded. You must disregard any capital loss you make from a CGT event that happens to the shares during this period. |\n| 12 months or more but less than 10 years | A capital gain or capital loss that you made from a CGT event happening to the shares is disregarded. |\n| 10 years or more | The first element of the cost base and reduced cost base for the share will become its [market value](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/capital-gains-tax/market-valuation-of-assets) on the tenth anniversary of the share being issued to you. This means that you will recognise any capital gains or losses that happen from this point in time. |\n\n\n\nFor more information, see:\n\n\n\u2022[Qualifying as an early stage innovation company](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/income-deductions-and-concessions/incentives-and-concessions/tax-incentives-for-innovation/in-detail/tax-incentives-for-early-stage-investors/qualifying-as-an-early-stage-innovation-company#How_does_the_modified_CGT_treatment_apply_to_a_roll_over_)\n\u2022[Tax incentives for early stage investors](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/income-deductions-and-concessions/incentives-and-concessions/tax-incentives-for-innovation/in-detail/tax-incentives-for-early-stage-investors)\n\n\n\n\n***If a CGT roll-over applies***\n\nGenerally, special rules apply to preserve the modified CGT treatment for eligible shares in an ESIC that are subject to a CGT roll-over. However, the modified CGT treatment does not apply if the scrip for scrip rollover or wholly-owned company rollover applies to your ESIC shares.\n\nFor more information, see\n[How does the modified CGT treatment apply to a roll over](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/income-deductions-and-concessions/incentives-and-concessions/tax-incentives-for-innovation/in-detail/tax-incentives-for-early-stage-investors/for-investors#HowdoesthemodifiedCGTtreatmentapplytoaro)\n.\n\n**Venture capital investment**\n\nVenture capital investors typically invest in a VCLP, an ESVCLP or an AFOF to diversify their portfolio of venture capital assets. A VCLP, ESVCLP or an AFOF is an intermediary that invests in shares and units and it is taxed on a 'flow through' basis.\n\nThe partners of a VCLP, an ESVCLP or an AFOF make a capital gain or capital loss from a CGT event relating to those shares and units, not the VCLP, the ESVCLP or the AFOF itself. For CGT purposes, each partner owns a proportion of each share or unit and calculates a capital gain or capital loss on their share of each share or unit. A capital gain or capital loss on your share of each share or unit may be disregarded.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Venture capital and early stage venture capital limited partnerships](https://www.ato.gov.au/business/venture-capital-and-early-stage-venture-capital-limited-partnerships/)\n.\n\n***Carried interest (CGT event K9)***\n\nThe carried interest of a general partner is the partner's entitlement to a distribution from the VCLP, the ESVCLP or the AFOF, normally contingent on profits attained for the limited partners in a VCLP, the ESVCLP or the AFOF. You have a capital gain when you become entitled to receive a payment of a carried interest under CGT event K9.\n\n**Non-assessable payments**\n\nYou may need to adjust the cost base of shares or units for CGT calculations if you receive a non-assessable payment without disposing of your shares or units. A payment or distribution can include money and property.\n\nThe amount of the non-assessable payment is adjusted to exclude certain amounts relating to a VCLP, an ESVCLP, an AFOF and an ESIC.\n\nYou need to keep accurate records of the amount and date of any non-assessable payments on your shares and units.\n\n***Non-assessable payments after a recent restructure***\n\nAs a result of some stapling arrangements, some investors in managed funds have received units which have a very low cost base. The payment of certain non-assessable amounts in excess of the cost base of the units will result in these investors making a capital gain.\n\n***Non-assessable payments from a company (CGT event G1)***\n\nNon-assessable payments to shareholders are not very common and would generally be made only if a company has shareholder approval to reduce its share capital. If you receive a non-assessable payment from a company (that is, a payment that is not a dividend or an amount that is taken to be a dividend for tax purposes), you need to adjust the cost base of the shares at the time of the payment. These payments will often be referred to as a return of capital. If the amount of the non-assessable payment is not more than the cost base of the shares at the time of payment, you reduce the cost base and reduced cost base by the amount of the payment.\n\nYou make a capital gain if the amount of the non-assessable payment is more than the cost base of the shares. The amount of the capital gain is equal to the excess. If you make a capital gain, you reduce the cost base and reduced cost base of the shares to nil. You can't make a capital loss from the receipt of a non-assessable payment.\n\nInterim liquidation distributions that are not dividends can be treated in the same way as other non-assessable payments under\n[CGT event G1](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATTABLESHARES%22&PiT=99991231235958#TABLESHARES)\n.\n\nThe exception is if the payment is made to you by a liquidator after the declaration and the company is dissolved within 18 months of such a payment. In this case, you include the payment as capital proceeds on the cancellation of your shares (rather than you making a capital gain at the time of the payment). In preparing your tax return, you may delay declaring any capital gain until your shares are cancelled unless you are advised by the liquidator in writing that the company will not cease to exist within 18 months of you receiving the payment.\n\n**Example 45: non-assessable payments**\n> Rob bought 1,500 shares in RAP Ltd on 1 July 1995 for $5 each, including brokerage and stamp duty. On 30 November 2008, as part of a shareholder-approved scheme for the reduction of RAP Ltd's share capital, he received a non-assessable payment of 50 cents per share. Just before Rob received the payment, the cost base of each share (without indexation) was $5.\n\n> As the amount of the payment is not more than the cost base (without indexation), he reduces the cost base of each share at 30 November 2008 by the amount of the payment to $4.50 ($5.00 - 50 cents). As Rob has chosen not to index the cost base, he can claim the CGT discount if he disposes of the shares in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n***Non-assessable payments from a unit trust (CGT event E4 or E10)***\n\nUnit trusts often make non-assessable payments to unit holders. Depending on whether that non-assessable payment is greater than or less than the cost base of your units in respect of which your payment is received, you will either make a capital gain or have the cost base and reduced cost base of your units reduced. Your CGT obligations in this situation are explained in\n[Trust non-assessable payments (CGT event E4)](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/capital-gains-tax/shares-and-similar-investments/trust-non-assessable-payments-cgt-event-e4)\n.\n\nFor units you sold during the 2023\u201324 income year and with respect to which you received a non-assessable payment prior to selling, you must determine your CGT event E4 (or E10) position separate to the calculation of any CGT event A1 position that happens on the sale of the units. This may necessarily include adjusting the cost base and reduced cost base of the units for the non-assessable payments you received during 2023\u201324 up to the date of sale. You then use the adjusted cost base and reduced cost base to work out your A1 capital gain or capital loss.\n\nIf the unit or interest is not in an AMIT, the CGT event is E4, and if the unit or interest is in an AMIT, the CGT event is E10.\n\n***Non-assessable payments under a demerger***\n\nIf you received a non-assessable payment under an eligible\n[demerger](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATDEMERGERS%22&PiT=99991231235958#DEMERGERS)\n, you don't adjust the cost base and the reduced cost base of your shares or units. Instead, you adjust your cost base and reduced cost base under the demerger rules. You may have made a capital gain on the non-assessable payment if it exceeded the cost base of your original shares or units, although you are able to choose a CGT rollover.\n\nAn eligible demerger is one that happened on or after 1 July 2002 and satisfies certain tests. The head entity will normally advise shareholders or unit holders if this is the case.\n\n**Investments in foreign hybrids**\n\nA foreign hybrid is an entity that is taxed in Australia as a company but taxed overseas as a partnership. This can include a limited partnership, a limited liability partnership and a US limited liability company.\n\nIf you have an investment in a foreign hybrid (referred to as being a member of a foreign hybrid), you are treated for Australian tax purposes as having an interest in each asset of the partnership.\n\nAs a consequence, any capital gain or capital loss made in relation to the assets of a foreign hybrid is taken to be made by the member.\n\n**General value shifting regime (GVSR)**\n\nIf you own shares in a company or units (or other fixed interests) in a trust, you may be\n[affected by value shifting rules](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/corporate-tax-measures-and-assurance/consolidation/in-detail/general-value-shifting-regime/who-it-affects)\n. These rules may apply to you if:\n\n\n\u2022you have interests in a company or trust in which equity or loan interests have been issued or bought back at other than market value, or varied such that the values of some interests have increased while others have decreased (direct value shifts on interests)\n\u2022you have interests in an entity whose dealings (such as providing loans or other services, or transferring assets) with another entity are neither at market value nor arm's length and both entities are under the same control or ownership (indirect value shifting).\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, see\n[Guide to the general value shifting regime](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/corporate-tax-measures-and-assurance/consolidation/in-detail/general-value-shifting-regime/guide-to-the-general-value-shifting-regime)\n.\n\n**Using the capital gain or capital loss worksheet for shares**\n\nIn example 46, Tony uses the indexation method, the discount method and the 'other' method to calculate his capital gain so he can decide which method gives him the best result. To calculate your capital gain when you acquire or dispose of shares, see how to complete the\n[Capital gain or capital loss worksheet 2024](https://www.ato.gov.au/forms-and-instructions/capital-gain-or-capital-loss-worksheet-2024)\n.\n\nFor a description of each method and when you can use each one, see\n[How to work out your capital gain or capital loss](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATHOWTOWORKOUTYOURCAPITALGAINORCAPITALLOSS%22&PiT=99991231235958#HOWTOWORKOUTYOURCAPITALGAINORCAPITALLOSS)\n.\n\nRemember that if you bought and sold your shares within 12 months, you must use the 'other' method to calculate your capital gain. If you owned your shares for 12 months or more, you may be able to use either the discount method or the indexation method, whichever gives you the better result.\n\nBecause each share in a parcel of shares is a separate CGT asset, you can use different methods to work out the amount of any capital gain for shares within a parcel. This may be to your advantage if you have capital losses to apply. See\nExample 12\n.\n\n**Example 46: using all 3 methods to calculate a capital gain**\n> On 1 July 1994, Tony bought 10,000 shares in Kimbin Ltd for $2 each. He paid brokerage of $250 and stamp duty of $50.\n\n> On 1 July 2023, Kimbin Ltd offered each of its shareholders one right for each 4 shares owned to acquire shares in the company for $1.80 each. The market value of the shares at the time was $2.50.

Instead, you include these costs in the cost base or reduced cost base of your forestry interest for CGT purposes when the interest is subsequently disposed of prior to harvest or when the harvest proceeds are received.\n\n**Example 48: acquiring a forestry interest in a forestry managed investment scheme**\n> Julian acquires a forestry interest in Australian Forests Limited (AFL), an FMIS, from Caroline in August 2023 for $14,000 (at market value). As Julian did not purchase the interest from the forestry manager of the scheme, he is a subsequent participant and also holds the interest on capital account as he does not trade in securities.\n\n> Julian is not entitled to a deduction for the $14,000 paid to Caroline for the acquisition of the interest. Instead, this amount will form part of the cost base or reduced cost base of the interest when Julian later sells the interest or receives harvest proceeds.\n\n\n\n\n\n***Ongoing costs of ownership***\n\nYou can claim a deduction for the ongoing costs of holding your forestry interest if the amounts would have been deductible were they paid by an initial participant. That is, you don't include these costs in your cost base or reduced cost base.\n\n***Treatment of thinning receipts***\n\nAmounts you receive for thinning are excluded from the CGT treatment of your forestry interest. These amounts are included in your assessable income. Include this amount at question\n**23 Forestry managed investment scheme income**\n\u2013 label A in your supplementary tax return.\n\n**Example 49: treatment of ongoing fees and thinning receipts**\n> Julian pays $1,000 to AFL in annual management and services fees in each year of income after acquiring the interest from Caroline. These amounts are not included in the cost base or reduced cost base of the forestry interest and Julian can claim a deduction for these amounts. This is because Julian would have been able to deduct these amounts if he was an initial participant.\n\n> Julian receives $1,500 for thinning in December 2023 from AFL. This amount is not subject to CGT and is instead included in his assessable income for the income year ended 30 June 20\u201324.\n\n\n\n\n\n***Treatment of sale and harvest proceeds***\n\nAmounts you receive from a CGT event that happens to your forestry interest, for example the sale of your forestry interest or as harvest proceeds, are capital proceeds for CGT purposes; see\n[What are capital proceeds?](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATWHATARECAPITALPROCEEDS%22&PiT=99991231235958#WHATARECAPITALPROCEEDS)\n\n*Sale and harvest receipts: forestry interest no longer held*\n\nIf a CGT event happens when you cease to hold your forestry interest (because you sell your interest or receive the harvest proceeds), you will also need to include at question\n**23 Forestry managed investment scheme income**\n\u2013 label\n**A**\nin your supplementary tax return the lesser of the following 2 amounts:\n\n\n\u2022the market value of your forestry interest (at the time of the CGT event)\n\u2022the amount (if any) by which the total forestry scheme deductions (ongoing costs of ownership) exceeds the incidental forestry scheme receipts (for example, thinning).\n\n\n\n\nTo work out any capital gain or capital loss, the cost base or reduced cost base of your forestry interest increases by this amount.\n\n**Example 50: sale of a forestry interest in an FMIS**\n> Julian is a subsequent participant who sold his forestry interest on 30 May 2024 at the market value of $20,000. He purchased the forestry interest for $14,000 on 1 August 2023. A CGT event happens when he sells the forestry interest. The original cost base of his forestry interest is $14,000.\n\n> While holding his forestry interest, he has claimed $4,000 in deductions (total forestry scheme deductions). This amount relates to lease fees, annual management fees, and the cost of felling that he has paid to the forestry manager.

He received his first harvest payment of $5,000 in 2022\u201323.\n\n> The market value of John's forestry interest was $20,000 just before he received his first harvest payment (which is a CGT event). After John received this first harvest payment, the market value of his forestry interest was reduced to $15,000. His original cost base was $14,000.\n\n> In the time that he has held his interest, he has claimed $4,000 in deductions (his total forestry scheme deductions). This relates to lease fees, annual management fees and the cost of felling that he has paid to the forestry manager. John also received $1,500 from thinning proceeds (his incidental forestry scheme receipts) in the same period.\n\n> **Step 1**\n> \n> \n> \u2022The market value of the forestry interest (at the time of the CGT event) = $20,000.\n> \u2022The amount by which the total forestry scheme deductions exceed the incidental forestry scheme receipts: $4,000 - $1,500 = $2,500.\n\n> The amount to use in step 2 of the calculation is $2,500.\n\n> **Step 2**\n> \n> `$2,500 \u00d7 $5,000 \u00f7 $20,000 = $625`\n\n> **Step 3**\n\n> John includes $625 at question\n> **23 Forestry managed investment scheme income**\n> \u2013 label\n> **A**\n> in his supplementary tax return.\n\n> **Step 4**\n\n> The market value of John's forestry interest has been reduced by 25%\n> \n> `(5,000 \u00f7 20,000 \u00d7 100).`\n\n> John's adjusted cost base is:\n> \n> `(25% \u00d7 $14,000) + $625 = $4,125.`\n\n> Accordingly, John works out his capital gain to be $5,000 - $4,125 = $875.

In general, the rules operate to ensure your capital proceeds are the market value of the CGT asset at the time of its disposal.\n\nIn the same way, the TOFA rules may determine that the first element of the cost base and reduced cost base of your CGT asset is the market value of the CGT asset at the time of its acquisition.\n\nThe TOFA rules can also affect other elements of the cost base and reduced cost base if the financial arrangement represents consideration for something obtained which is relevant to the other elements of the cost base and reduced cost base.\n\n**Example 52: TOFA and capital proceeds and cost base rules**\n> Both ABC Co and Aus Co are subject to the TOFA rules.\n\n> On 1 July 2023, ABC Co enters into a contract to sell land to Aus Co for $250,000. Under the terms of the contract, title to the land passes in 6 months' time on 1 January 2024, and payment is to be made on 1 July 2025 (that is, 18 months after title to the land passes). The market value of the land on 1 January 2024 is $200,000.\n\n> On 1 January 2024 when ABC Co passes the title to the land to Aus Co it will start to have a financial arrangement as consideration for the disposal of its land. The TOFA rules will operate so that ABC Co is taken to have received an amount equal to the market value of the land when it is provided. Therefore, ABC Co's capital proceeds are $200,000. Similarly, Aus Co's first element of its cost base is $200,000. For both ABC Co and Aus Co, the additional $50,000 relates to a financial arrangement which is taxed under the TOFA rules and is not subject to the CGT rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n**TOFA rules apply instead of CGT rules**\n\nWhere the application of the TOFA rules results in you making a gain or loss from your financial arrangement that is a CGT asset, a capital gain or capital loss that is made from a CGT event that happens to the CGT asset is disregarded. In general, this does not apply for superannuation entities, where CGT remains the primary code for calculating gains and losses from financial arrangements.\n\n**Hedging financial arrangements**\n\nThe\n[TOFA rules](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/corporate-tax-measures-and-assurance/taxation-of-financial-arrangements-tofa/in-detail/guide-to-the-taxation-of-financial-arrangements-tofa)\nprovide for a hedging tax-timing method that allows gains and losses from certain hedging financial arrangements to be characterised and taxed in accordance with the tax treatment of the underlying item being hedged. For example, if a valid hedging tax-timing method election is in effect, gains or losses from a hedging financial arrangement used to hedge against risks associated with a CGT asset will be treated as a capital gain or capital loss on the same basis as the capital gain or capital loss on the underlying CGT asset that is being hedged. If this applies to you, specify the amount of the gains or losses from the relevant hedging financial arrangements in your\n[Capital gains tax (CGT) schedule 2024](https://www.ato.gov.au/forms-and-instructions/capital-gains-tax-schedule-2024)\n.\n\n### Real estate and main residence\n\nExplains your CGT obligations for real estate.

during construction](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATDEATHDURINGCONSTRUCTION%22&PiT=99991231235958#DEATHDURINGCONSTRUCTION)\n\n\n\n\nApart from the main residence rules, capital gains and capital losses on real estate are worked out under the rules set out earlier in this guide.\n\nLand is a CGT asset. In some cases, improvements made to land are treated as separate CGT assets, see\n[Separate assets](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATSEPARATEASSETS%22&PiT=99991231235958#SEPARATEASSETS)\n. A depreciating asset that is found in a building (for example, carpet or a hot-water system) is also taken to be a separate CGT asset from the building. When a CGT event happens to your property, you must work out a capital gain or capital loss for each CGT asset it comprises (or balancing adjustment in the case of depreciating assets sold with the property).\n\nThe most common CGT event that happens to real estate is its sale or disposal, CGT event A1. The time of the event is:\n\n\n\u2022when you enter into the contract for the disposal\n\u2022if there is no contract, when the change of ownership occurs\n\u2022if the asset is compulsorily acquired by an entity, the earliest of when\n\n\n-you received compensation from the entity\n-the entity became the asset's owner\n-the entity entered it under a power of compulsory acquisition\n-the entity took possession under that power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf land is disposed of under a contract, it is taken to have been disposed of when the contract is entered into, not the settlement date. The fact that a contract is subject to a condition, such as finance approval, will generally not affect this date.\n\nYou are not required to include any capital gain or capital loss in your tax return for the relevant income year until settlement occurs. When settlement occurs, you must include any capital gain or capital loss in your tax return for the income year in which the contract was made. If an assessment has already been made for that income year, you may need to have that assessment amended. Where an assessment is amended to include a net capital gain and a liability for\n[shortfall interest charge (SIC)](https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Interest-and-penalties/Interest-we-charge/Shortfall-interest-charge/)\narises, remission of that interest charge will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Generally, it would be expected that the SIC would be remitted in full where requests for amendment are lodged within a reasonable time after the date of settlement, which, in most cases, is considered to be one month. If you consider that the SIC should be remitted, you should provide reasons why when you request the amendment to your assessment.\n\n**Rules to keep in mind**\n\nThere are a few rules to keep in mind when you calculate your capital gain or capital loss from real estate, in particular rules relating to:\n\n\n\u2022the costs of owning the real estate\n\u2022cost base adjustments for capital works deductions.\n\n\n\n\n***Costs of owning***\n\nYou don't include rates, insurance, land tax, maintenance and interest on money you borrowed to buy the property or finance improvements to it in the reduced cost base. You only include them in the cost base if you:\n\n\n\u2022acquired the property under a contract entered into after 20 August 1991 (or if you didn't acquire it under a contract, you became the owner after that date)\n\u2022couldn't claim a deduction for the costs because you did not use the property to produce assessable income, for example, it was vacant land, your main residence, or a holiday home during the period.\n\n\n\n\n***Cost base adjustments for capital works deductions***\n\nIn working out a capital gain for property that you used to produce assessable income (such as a rental property or business premises), you may need to exclude from the cost base and reduced cost base capital works deductions you have claimed in any income year (or omitted to claim, but can still claim, because the period for amending the relevant income tax assessment has not expired).\n\nFor information on when property (for example, a building, structure or other capital improvement to land) is treated for CGT purposes as a CGT asset separate from the land, see:\n\n\n\u2022[Does capital gains tax apply to you?](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATDOESCAPITALGAINSTAXAPPLYTOYOU%22&PiT=99991231235958#DOESCAPITALGAINSTAXAPPLYTOYOU)\n\u2022[Major capital improvements to a dwelling acquired before 20 September 1985](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATMAJORCAPITALIMPROVEMENTSTOADWELLINGACQUIREDBEFORE20SEPTEMBER1985%22&PiT=99991231235958#MAJORCAPITALIMPROVEMENTSTOADWELLINGACQUIREDBEFORE20SEPTEMBER1985)\n.\n\n\n\n\nYou must exclude from the cost base of a CGT asset (including a building, structure or other capital improvement to land that is treated as a separate asset for CGT purposes) the amount of capital works deductions you claimed (or omitted to but can still claim because the period for amending the relevant income tax assessment has not expired) for the asset if you acquired the asset:\n\n\n\u2022after 7:30pm AEST on 13 May 1997, or\n\u2022before that time and the expenditure that gave rise to the capital works deductions was incurred after 30 June 1999.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, if you omitted to claim capital works deductions because you did not have sufficient information to determine the amount and nature of the construction expenditure, there is no need to exclude the amount of such deductions from the cost base of the CGT asset.\n\n***Reduced cost base***\n\nYou exclude the amount of the capital works deductions you claimed (or omitted to claim but can still claim because the period for amending the relevant income tax assessment has not expired) from the reduced cost base. However, if you omitted to claim capital works deductions because you did not have sufficient information to determine the amount and nature of the construction expenditure, there is no need to exclude the amount of such deductions from the reduced cost base of the CGT asset.\n\n**Example 53: capital works deduction**\n> Zoran acquired a rental property on 1 July 1998 for $200,000. Before disposing of the property on 30 June 2023, he had claimed $10,000 in capital works deductions.\n\n> At the time of disposal, the cost base of the property was $210,250. Zoran must reduce the cost base of the property by $10,000 to $200,250.\n\n\n\n\n\n***Rollover***\n\nThere is generally no rollover or exemption for a capital gain you make when you sell an asset and put the proceeds into a superannuation fund. There is also no general exemption or rollover when you use the proceeds to purchase an identical or similar asset, or you transfer an asset into a superannuation fund. For example, a rollover is not available if you:\n\n\n\u2022sell a rental property and put the proceeds into a superannuation fund, or\n\u2022use the proceeds to purchase another rental property.\n\n\n\n\nA\n[rollover](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATROLLOVERS%22&PiT=99991231235958#ROLLOVERS)\nmay be available in special circumstances, in particular for:\n\n\n\u2022destruction\n\u2022compulsory acquisition of property\n\u2022marriage or relationship breakdown.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, an asset or the capital proceeds from the sale of an asset may be transferred into a superannuation fund in order to satisfy certain conditions under the small business retirement exemption.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Small business CGT concessions](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/income-deductions-and-concessions/income-and-deductions-for-business/concessions-offsets-and-rebates/small-business-cgt-concessions/small-business-cgt-concessions-eligibility-conditions/cgt-concessions-eligibility-overview)\n.\n\n***Keeping records***\n\nKeep appropriate records, see\n[Records relating to real estate](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATRECORDSRELATINGTOREALESTATE%22&PiT=99991231235958#RECORDSRELATINGTOREALESTATE)\n.\n\n**Sale of a rental property**\n\n**Example 54**\nshows how you would calculate your capital gain on the sale of your rental property.\n\nThe\n[sample worksheet (PDF 95KB)](https://www.ato.gov.au/uploadedFiles/Content/IND/Downloads/CGT-worksheet-2024-Brett.pdf)\nshows how you would complete the\n*Capital gain or capital loss worksheet*\nfor this example.\n\n**Example 54: sale of a rental property**\n> Brett purchased a residential rental property on 1 July 1997. The price he paid was $150,000, of which $6,000 was attributable to depreciating assets. He also paid $20,000 in total for pest and building inspections, stamp duty and solicitor's fees.\n\n> In the next few years, Brett incurred the following expenses on the property:\n> \n> \n> \u2022interest on money borrowed \u2013 $10,000\n> \u2022*add*\n> rates and land tax of $8,000\n> \u2022*add*\n> deductible (non-capital) repairs of $15,000\n> \u2022the total expenses are\n> **$33,000**\n> .\n\n> Brett can't include the expenses of $33,000 in the cost base, as he was able to claim a deduction for them.\n\n> When Brett decided to sell the property, a real estate agent advised him that if he spent around $30,000 on major structural improvements, the property would be valued at around $500,000. The major structural improvements were completed on 1 October 2023 at a cost of $30,000.\n\n> On 1 February 2024, he sold the property for $500,000 (of which $4,000 was attributable to depreciating assets).\n\n> Brett could not claim any capital works deductions for the original construction costs, as construction of the property began before 18 July 1985. However, he could claim a capital works deduction of $255 ($30,000 \u00d7 2.5% \u00d7 124 \u00f7 365) for the major structural improvements.\n\n> For information on capital works that qualify for a deduction, see\n> [Rental properties 2024](https://www.ato.gov.au/forms-and-instructions/rental-properties-2024)\n> . For information on how capital works deductions affect the CGT cost base, see\n> [Cost base adjustments for capital works deductions](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCOSTBASEADJUSTMENTSFORCAPITALWORKSDEDUCTIONS%22&PiT=99991231235958#COSTBASEADJUSTMENTSFORCAPITALWORKSDEDUCTIONS)\n> .\n\n> This is Brett's only capital gain for the year, and he has no capital losses to offset from this income year or previous years.\n\n> Brett works out his cost base as follows.\n\n> 1. Purchase price of property (not including depreciating assets) is $144,000.\n\n> 2.\n> *Add:*\n> \n> \n> -pest and building inspections, stamp duty and solicitor's fees on purchase of the property of $20,000\n> -capital expenditure (major structural improvements) of $30,000 and\n> *subtract*\n> capital works deduction of $255 which equals $29,745\n> -real estate agent's fees and solicitor's fees on sale of the property of $12,500\n\n> 3. The\n> **cost base unindexed is $206,245.**\n\n> Brett deducts his cost base from his capital proceeds (sale price) as follows:\n\n> 1. Proceeds from selling the house (not including depreciating assets) are $496,000.\n\n> 2.\n> *Subtract*\n> cost base unindexed\n> \n> `$496,000 - $206,245 =\n> $289,755`\n\n> He decides the discount method will give him the best result, so he uses this method to calculate his capital gain:\n> \n> `$289,755 \u00d7 50% = $144,877`\n\n> Brett writes $144,877 at question\n> **18**\n> \u2013 label\n> **A**\n> in his supplementary tax return.\n\n> Brett writes $289,755 at question\n> **18**\n> \u2013 label\n> **H Total current year capital gains**\n> in his supplementary tax return. Brett must also make balancing adjustment calculations for his depreciating assets. Because he used the property 100% for taxable purposes, he will not make a capital gain or capital loss from the depreciating assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Investing in affordable housing**\n\nAn additional CGT discount of up to 10% is allowed to Australian resident individuals who invest in affordable housing.\n\nA property qualifies as 'affordable' housing if rent is charged at below market rate, and it is made available for eligible tenants on low to moderate incomes. The property must be managed by an eligible community housing provider (CHP).\n\nOnly dwellings that are Australian residential premises can be used to provide affordable housing. Commercial residential premises don't qualify as affordable housing. Caravans, mobile homes and houseboats are not considered residential premises.\n\nThe additional affordable housing capital gain discount applies to CGT events occurring on or after 30 December 2020.\n\n***Eligibility for the affordable housing CGT discount***\n\nThe following conditions must be met to qualify for up to 10% additional capital gain discount for investing in affordable housing:\n\n\n\u2022residential premises \u2013 the dwelling is Taxable Australian Real Property (TARP) and is residential premises that is not commercial residential premises and is tenanted or available to be tenanted\n\u2022property management \u2013 the tenancy of the dwelling or its occupancy is exclusively managed by an eligible CHP\n\u2022affordable housing certification \u2013 the eligible CHP has given each entity that holds an ownership interest in the dwelling certification that the dwelling was used to provide affordable housing\n\u2022NRAS \u2013 no entity that has an ownership interest in the dwelling is entitled to receive a National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS) incentive for the NRAS year, and\n\u2022MIT membership \u2013 if the ownership interest in the dwelling is owned by a Managed Investment Trust (MIT), the tenant does not have an interest in the MIT that passes the non-portfolio test.\n\n\n\n\nTo qualify for the discount, an investor must have provided affordable housing on or after 1 January 2018 for a period, or intermittent periods, totalling at least 1,095 days. The investor must have invested either directly, or through a trust including where there is an interposed entity between the investor and the trust. The trust that provides the affordable housing and any interposed entities may be a trust, a managed investment trust or partnership, but can't be a public unit trust or superannuation fund.\n\n***How to calculate the additional CGT discount***\n\nThe additional affordable housing CGT discount percentage, which will be 10% or less, is calculated as follows:\n\n`(CGT discount percent \u00f7 5) \u00d7 (Affordable housing days \u00f7 Total ownership days)`\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\u2022CGT discount percentage is the discount of up to 50% on capital gains.\n\u2022Affordable housing days are the number of days the dwelling was used to provide affordable housing (on or after 1 January 2018) during its ownership period (and shown on the affordable housing certificate), subtract the number of days when the individual receiving the affordable housing capital gains discount was a foreign or temporary resident.\n\u2022Total ownership days are the number of days the dwelling was held from the time it was acquired until a CGT event occurred to it, excluding any period of foreign or temporary residency after 8 May 2012.\n\n\n\n\n***Affordable housing certificate***\n\nIf you invested directly in affordable housing, you should have received an annual affordable housing certificate from your CHP showing the number of days your investment was used to provide affordable housing. If you invested in affordable housing through a trust or managed investment trust, you may need to contact the trustee to get the number of affordable housing days in order to work out your additional affordable housing CGT discount percentage.\n\n**Example 55: working out the aggregate period and affordable housing discount**\n> On 1 February 2020, Lisa purchased a dwelling that is residential premises.\n\n> During her ownership assume Lisa uses the dwelling as follows:\n> \n> \n> \u2022left it vacant and undertook repairs from when she acquired it on 1 February 2020 (the acquisition date for CGT purposes) until 1 March 2020 (30 days)\n> \u2022rented it out through a CHP as affordable housing from 2 March 2020 until 4 February 2024 (1,435 days)\n> \u2022rented it out through a real estate property manager at market rates (that is, not providing affordable housing) from 5 February 2024 until 31 May 2024 (117 days), and\n> \u2022vacated the property and prepared it for sale on and after 1 June 2024 (23 days).\n\n> On 23 June 2024 (the disposal date for CGT purposes), Lisa signed a contract to sell the dwelling, with settlement occurring on 23 July 2024. Lisa made a capital gain of $100,000.\n\n> Lisa held the dwelling for a total of 1,605 days. She used the dwelling to provide affordable housing for 1,435 of the 1,605 days. As Lisa used the dwelling to provide affordable housing for more than 1,095 days, she would be eligible for the additional affordable housing capital gains discount (assuming the dwelling meets the other requirements).\n\n> Lisa's affordable housing capital gain discount percentage is equal to:\n> \n> `(capital gain discount percentage \u00f7 5) \u00d7 (Affordable housing days \u00f7 Total ownership days)`\n\n> She works this out as:\n> \n> `(50% \u00f7 5) \u00d7 (1,435 \u00f7 1,605) = 8.94%`\n\n> (this is the discount percent available for the provision of affordable housing)\n\n> The discount percentage is equal to the sum of the capital gain discount percentage and the affordable housing discount capital gain percentage. That is, 58.94% (50% plus 8.94%).\n\n> Lisa reduces her capital gain by the discount percentage. Lisa has capital gain of $100,000. She works out her capital gain after capital gains discount as:\n> \n> `Capital gain \u00d7 (1 - discount %)\n>   \n> $100,000 \u00d7 (1 - 58.94%) = $41,060`\n\n> Lisa includes only $41,060 of the $100,000 capital gain in her assessable income from her sale of this property, as a result of investment in affordable housing and meeting all its conditions.\n\n> **Note:**\n> Capital gains can also be reduced by capital losses and other concessions or exemptions, however, for the purpose of this example, these have not been factored in.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, see\n[CGT discount for affordable housing](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/capital-gains-tax/property-and-capital-gains-tax/cgt-discount-for-affordable-housing)\n.\n\n**Other CGT events affecting real estate**\n\n**CGT event B1**\nhappens to real estate if you enter into an agreement where the new owner is entitled to possession of the land or the receipt of rents and profits before becoming entitled to a transfer or conveyance of the land.\n\nWhere this happens under a contract, it is known as a 'terms contract' and the new owner usually completes the purchase by paying the balance of the purchase price and receiving the instrument of transfer and title deeds.\n\nIt may also happen where an agreement is made with a relative or other party to use and enjoy the property for a specified period, after which title to the property passes to them. It will not happen where, under an arrangement, title to a property may pass at an unspecified time in the future.\n\nCGT event B1 happens when use and enjoyment of the land is first obtained by the new owner. Use and enjoyment of the land from a practical point of view takes place at the time the new owner gets possession of the land or the date the new owner becomes entitled to the receipt of rents and profits.\n\nIf the agreement falls through before completion and title to the land does not pass to the new owner, you may be entitled to amend your assessment for the year in which CGT event B1 happened.\n\n**CGT event C1**\nhappens if an asset is lost or destroyed. This event may happen if, for example, a building on your land is destroyed by fire. Your capital proceeds for CGT event C1 happening include any insurance proceeds you may receive for the loss or destruction. The market value substitution rule for capital proceeds that generally applies if you receive no capital proceeds does not apply if CGT event C1 happens.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Loss, destruction or compulsory acquisition of an asset](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATLOSSDESTRUCTIONORCOMPULSORYACQUISITIONOFANASSET2%22&PiT=99991231235958#LOSSDESTRUCTIONORCOMPULSORYACQUISITIONOFANASSET2)\n.\n\n**CGT event D1**\nhappens if you give someone a right to reside in a dwelling. The capital proceeds include money (but not rent) and the value of any property you receive.\n\nThe market value substitution rule for capital proceeds (see\n[Definitions](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATA4%22&PiT=99991231235958#A4)\n) applies if:\n\n\n\u2022the amount of capital proceeds you receive is more or less than the market value of the right, and\n\u2022you and the person you granted the right to were not dealing with each other at arm's length in connection with the event.\n\n\n\n\n**CGT event D2**\nhappens if you grant an option to a person or an entity, or renew or extend an option that you had granted.\n\nThe amount of your capital gain or capital loss from CGT event D2 is the difference between what you receive for granting the right and any expenditure you incurred on it. The CGT discount does not apply to CGT event D2.\n\n**Example 56: granting of an option**\n> You were approached by Colleen, who was interested in buying your land. On 30 June 2023, you granted her an option to purchase your land within 12 months for $200,000. Colleen pays you $10,000 for the grant of the option. You incur legal fees of $500. You made a capital gain in the 2022\u201323 income year of $9,500.\n\n\n\n\n\n***Exercise of an option***\n\nIf the option you granted is later exercised, you ignore any capital gain or capital loss you made from the grant, renewal or extension. You may have to amend your income tax assessment for an earlier income year.\n\nSimilarly, any capital gain or capital loss that the grantee would otherwise make from the exercise of the option is disregarded.\n\nThe effect of the exercise of an option depends on whether the option was a 'call option' or a 'put option'. A call option is one that binds the grantor to dispose of an asset. A put option binds the grantor to acquire an asset.\n\n**Example 57: granting of an option (continued)**\n> On 1 February 2024, Colleen exercised the option you granted her. You disregard the capital gain that you made in 2022\u201323 income year and you request an amendment of your income tax assessment to exclude that amount. The $10,000 you received for the grant of the option is considered to be part of the capital proceeds for the sale of your property in the 2023\u201324 income year. Your capital gain or capital loss from the property is the difference between its cost base or reduced cost base and $210,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n**CGT event D4**\nhappens if you enter into a conservation covenant after 15 June 2000 over land that you own and if you receive capital proceeds for entering into the covenant.\n\nFrom 1 July 2002, CGT event D4 also happens if you receive no capital proceeds for entering into the covenant and you can claim a tax deduction for entering into the covenant. One of the conditions for a tax deduction is that the covenant is entered into with a deductible gift recipient or an Australian Government agency (that is, the Commonwealth, a state, a territory or one of their authorities).\n\nA 'conservation covenant' is a covenant that:\n\n\n\u2022restricts or prohibits certain activities on the land that could degrade the environmental value of the land\n\u2022is permanent and binding on current and future land owners (by way of registration on the title to the land where possible)\n\u2022is approved by the Environment Minister (including those entered into under a program approved by that Minister).\n\n\n\n\nIf CGT event D4 happens, you calculate your capital gain by comparing your capital proceeds from entering into the covenant with the portion of the cost base of the land that is attributable to the covenant.\n\nSimilarly, you calculate your capital loss by comparing your capital proceeds from entering into the covenant with the portion of the reduced cost base of the land that is attributable to the covenant.\n\nThe market value substitution rule for capital proceeds that generally applies if you receive no consideration for a CGT event does not apply if CGT event D4 happens. Instead, the capital proceeds are equal to the amount you can claim as a tax deduction for entering into the covenant.\n\nCalculate the relevant portion of the cost base and reduced cost base attributable to the covenant using this formula:\n\n`A \u00d7 (B \u00f7 C)`\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\u2022A is cost base (reduced cost base)\n\u2022B is capital proceeds from entering into the covenant over land\n\u2022C is those capital proceeds plus the market value of the land just after you enter into the covenant\n\n\n\n\nAs the conservation covenant will affect the value of the entire land you must use the cost base of the entire land in calculating the cost base apportioned to the covenant. This is the case even if the covenant specifically states within its terms that the restrictions as to use only apply to part of the land.\n\nCGT event D4 will not happen if you receive no capital proceeds and the conditions for a tax deduction for entering into the covenant are not satisfied. In this case, CGT event D1 will apply.\n\n***CGT events involving leases***\n\nThere are a number of CGT events that may apply to the lease of land.\n\n**CGT event F1**\nhappens if you grant a lease to a person or entity or if you extend or renew a lease that you had previously granted. In the case of a long-term lease (one that may be expected to continue for at least 50 years), you can choose to treat the grant (renewal or extension) of the lease as a part disposal of the underlying leased property.\n\n**Example 58: receiving an amount for granting a lease**\n> Elisabeth operates a profitable footwear retailing business and wishes to lease some shop space in a prestigious location in the Sydney CBD. However, the demand for shop space in the locality is great, and competition between prospective tenants is fierce. In order to ensure that she secures the lease of the particular shop space that she wants, Elisabeth pays John (the owner of the shop space) a premium of $6,000 in consideration for the grant of that particular lease.\n\n> She enters into the lease on 6 September 2008, and John incurs stamp duty of $300 and solicitor's fees of $500 on the grant of the lease.\n\n> John makes a capital gain of $5,200 from CGT event F1:\n> \n> \n> \u2022capital proceeds of $6,000\n> \u2022*subtract*\n> incidental costs of $800 (that is, stamp duty of $300 and solicitors' fees of $500)\n> \u2022capital gain is\n> **$5,200.**\n\n> For Elisabeth, this transaction results in CGT event C2 when the lease expires.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe amount of your capital gain or capital loss from CGT event F1 is the difference between any premium you got for granting the lease and the expenditure you incurred in granting it. The CGT discount does not apply to CGT event F1. The market value substitution rule for capital proceeds that generally applies if you receive no consideration for a CGT event does not apply if CGT event F1 happens.\n\n**CGT event F2**\nYou can choose for CGT event F2 to apply (rather than CGT event F1) when you grant, renew or extend a long-term lease (at least 50 years). It can apply if you are the owner of the underlying land or if you grant a sub-lease.\n\nYour capital proceeds if CGT event F2 happens are the greatest of:\n\n\n\u2022the market value of the freehold or head lease (at the time you grant, renew or extend the lease)\n\u2022the market value if you had not granted, renewed or extended the lease\n\u2022any premium from the grant, renewal or extension.\n\n\n\n\nThere are special cost base rules that apply if you choose for CGT event F2 to apply.\n\nFor any later CGT event that happens to the land or the lessor's lease of it, its cost base and reduced cost base (including the cost base and reduced cost base of any building, part of a building, structure or improvement that is treated as a separate CGT asset) excludes:\n\n\n\u2022any expenditure incurred before CGT event F2 happens\n\u2022the cost of any depreciating asset for which the lessor has deducted or can deduct an amount for its decline in value.\n\n\n\n\nThe 4th element of the property's cost base and reduced cost base includes any payment by the lessor to the lessee to vary or waive a term of the lease or for the forfeiture or surrender of the lease, reduced by the amount of any input tax credit to which the lessor is entitled for the variation or waiver.\n\n**CGT event F3**\nhappens if you make a payment to a lessee to vary a lease. You can only make a capital loss from this CGT event. Your capital loss is equal to the expenditure you incurred to change the lease.\n\n**CGT event F4**\nhappens if you (as lessee) receive a payment from the lessor for agreeing to vary or waive a term of the lease.\n\nYou can't make a capital loss from this CGT event. You will only make a capital gain from CGT event F4 if the amount of the payment you received exceeds the cost base of your lease at the time when the term is varied. In other cases, you will be required to adjust the cost base of your lease.\n\nThe market value substitution rule for capital proceeds that applies if you don't receive market value for a CGT event does not apply if CGT event F4 happens.\n\n**Example 59: Payment to lessee for change in lease**\n> Sam is the lessor of a commercial property. His tenant, Peter, currently holds a 3-year lease over the property, which has another 26 months to run. A business associate of Sam's wishes to lease the property from Sam for a 10-year period, beginning in 6 months' time, for twice the rent that Peter is currently paying. Sam approaches Peter with an offer of $5,000 cash for Peter to agree to vary the terms of the lease so that the lease will expire in 6 months' time. Peter agrees to vary the terms on 10 August 2023.\n\n> Sam will make a capital loss from CGT event F3 happening. His capital loss is equal to the expenditure of $5,000 he incurred.\n\n> For Peter, this transaction results in CGT event F4 happening. The cost base of Peter's lease at the time of the variation was $500. He makes a capital gain of $4,500 ($5,000 - $500).\n\n\n\n\n\nYou disregard any capital loss you make from the expiry, forfeiture, surrender or assignment of a lease (except one granted for 99 years or more) if you didn't use it solely or mainly for the purpose of producing assessable income, for example, if you used it for private purposes.\n\n**CGT event F5**\nhappens if you, as lessor, receive a payment for changing a lease.\n\nThe amount of your capital gain or capital loss from CGT event F5 is the difference between what you receive for changing the lease and any expenditure you incurred on it. The CGT discount does not apply to CGT event F5.\n\n**Subdivision of land**\n\nIf you subdivide a block of land, each block that results is registered with a separate title. For CGT purposes, the original land parcel is divided into 2 or more separate assets. Subdividing land does not result in a CGT event if you retain ownership of the subdivided blocks. Therefore, you don't make a capital gain or a capital loss at the time of the subdivision.\n\nHowever, you may make a capital gain or capital loss when you sell the subdivided blocks. The date you acquired the subdivided blocks is the date you acquired the original parcel of land and the cost base of the original land is divided between the subdivided blocks on a reasonable basis.\n\nFor more information, see Taxation Determination\n[TD 97/3](/law/view/document?LocID=%22TXD%2FTD973%2FNAT%2FATO%22&PiT=99991231235958#ATO)\n*Income tax: capital gains: if a parcel of land acquired after 19 September 1985 is subdivided into lots ('blocks'), do Parts 3-1 and 3-3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 treat a disposal of a block of the subdivided land as the disposal of part of an asset (the original land parcel) or the disposal of an asset in its own right (the subdivided block)?*\n\n***When the profit is ordinary income***\n\nYou may have made a profit from the subdivision and sale of land which occurred in the ordinary course of your business or which involved a commercial transaction or business operation entered into with the purpose of making a profit. In this case, the profit is ordinary income (see Taxation Ruling\n[TR 92/3](/law/view/document?LocID=%22TXR%2FTR923%2FNAT%2FATO%22&PiT=99991231235958#ATO)\n*Income tax: whether profits on isolated transactions are income*\n). You reduce any capital gain from the land by the amount otherwise included in your assessable income.\n\n**Example 60: land purchased before 20 September 1985, land subdivided after that date and house built on subdivided land**\n> In 1983, Mike bought a block of land that was less than 2 hectares. He subdivided the land into 2 blocks in May 2023 and began building a house on the rear block, which he finished in August 2023 and did not use as his main residence. He sold the rear block (including the house) in October 2023 for $650,000. Mike got a valuation from a qualified valuer who valued the rear block at $550,000 and the house at $100,000. The construction cost of the house was $85,000.\n\n> Mike acquired the rear block before 20 September 1985, so it is not subject to CGT. As the new house was constructed after 20 September 1985 on land purchased before that date, the house is taken to be a separate asset from the land. Mike is taken to have acquired the house in May 2023, when he began building it. Mike made a capital gain of $15,000 ($100,000 - $85,000) when he sold the house because he did not use it as his main residence.\n\n> As Mike had owned the house for less than 12 months, he used the 'other' method to calculate his capital gain.\n\n\n\n**Example 61: dwelling purchased on or after 20 September 1985 and land subdivided after that date**\n> Kym bought a house on a 0.2 hectare block of land in June 2023 for $350,000. The house was valued at $120,000 and the land at $230,000. Kym lived in the house as her main residence. She incurred $12,000 in stamp duty and legal fees purchasing the property.\n\n> Kym found the block was too big for her to maintain. In January 2024, she subdivided the land into 2 blocks of equal size \u2013 the front one with the house on it. She incurred $10,000 in survey, legal and subdivision application fees, and $1,000 to connect water and drainage to the rear block. In March 2024, she sold the rear block for $130,000.\n\n> As Kym sold the rear block of land separately, the main residence exemption does not apply to that land. She contacted several local real estate agents who advised her that the value of the front block was $15,000 higher than the rear block. Kym apportioned the $230,000 original cost base into $107,500 for the rear block (46.7%) and $122,500 for the front block (53.3%). Kym incurred $3,000 legal fees on the sale.\n\n> The cost base of the rear block is calculated as follows:\n> \n> \n> \u2022cost of the land $107,500\n> \u2022*add*\n> $5,604\n>   \n> \n> 46.7% of the $12,000 stamp duty and legal fees on the purchase\n> \u2022*add*\n> $4,670\n>   \n> \n> 46.7% of the $10,000 cost of survey, legal and application fees\n> \u2022*add*\n> $1,000\n>   \n> \n> cost of connecting water and drainage\n> \u2022*add*\n> $3,000\n>   \n> \n> legal fees on sale\n> \u2022The\n> **total is $121,774.**\n\n> The capital gain on the sale of the rear block is $8,226. She calculates this by subtracting the cost base ($121,774) from the sale price ($130,000). As Kym had owned the land for less than 12 months, she uses the 'other' method to calculate her capital gain.\n\n> Kym will get the full exemption for her house and the front block if she uses them as her main residence for the full period she owns them.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Amalgamation of title**\n\nThe amalgamation of the titles to various blocks of land that you own does not result in a CGT event happening.\n\nLand you acquired before 20 September 1985 that is amalgamated with land acquired on or after that date retains its pre-CGT status.\n\n**Example 62: amalgamation of title**\n> On 1 April 1984, Robert bought a block of land. On 1 June 2008, he bought another block adjacent to the first one. Robert amalgamated the titles to the 2 blocks into one title.\n\n> Robert is taken to have 2 separate assets. The first block continues to be treated as a pre-CGT asset.\n\n\n\n\n\n***Examples of CGT calculations affecting real estate***\n\nThere are a number of other examples in this guide that explain how to calculate your capital gain or capital loss on the sale of real estate:\n\n\n\u2022calculation of capital gain (including worksheet), where a person can choose the indexation or discount method to calculate their capital gain, see\nexample 13\n\u2022calculation of capital gain on property owned for 12 months or less, see\nexample 9\n\u2022recoupment of expenditure affecting CGT cost base calculation, see\nexample 6\n\u2022deductions affecting CGT cost base calculations, see\nexample 53\nand\nexample 54\n.\n\n\n\n\n**Main residence**\n\nGenerally, if you are an individual (not a company or trust) you can ignore a capital gain or capital loss from a CGT event that happens to your ownership interest in a dwelling that is your main residence (also referred to as 'your home'). However, special rules apply if the interest in the dwelling is held by the trustee of a Special Disability Trust. In such cases, the trustee of the Special Disability Trust will be eligible for any main residence exemption to the extent the individual principal beneficiary of the Special Disability Trust would have been if that individual principal beneficiary owned the interest in the dwelling.\n\nTo get the full exemption from CGT:\n\n\n\u2022the dwelling must have been your home for the whole period you owned it\n\u2022you must not have used the dwelling to produce assessable income\n\u2022any land on which the dwelling is situated must be 2 hectares or less\n\u2022you must not be an\n[excluded foreign resident](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATA4(EXCLUDEDFOREIGNRESIDENT)%22&PiT=99991231235958#A4(EXCLUDEDFOREIGNRESIDENT))\nat the time the CGT event occurs.\n\n\n\n\nIf you inherited a dwelling or a share of a dwelling and it was not the deceased's main residence, you are unlikely to get a full exemption.

This also applies to people who may otherwise be prevented from making contributions into superannuation due to:\n\n\n\u2022age\n\u2022work status\n\u2022contribution cap restrictions.\n\n\n\n\nThere are various\n[criteria to be eligible](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/super-for-individuals-and-families/super/growing-and-keeping-track-of-your-super/how-to-save-more-in-your-super/downsizer-super-contributions#Eligibilityrequirements)\nto make a downsizer contribution.\n\nTo make a downsizer contribution, the capital gain or loss from the sale of the home must be disregarded, in whole or part, because the property has been treated as your main residence (for the purposes of the main residence exemption for CGT). A partial main residence CGT exemption (for the purposes of the downsizer contribution eligibility) may apply in a variety of situations, including where the home:\n\n\n\u2022was not your main residence for the entire period of ownership\n\u2022was used to produce assessable income (in whole or part) for a period of time during the ownership\n\u2022is on land greater than 2 hectares.\n\n\n\n\nYou may not have a capital gain or loss to disregard because, for example:\n\n\n\u2022your home was a pre-CGT asset (that is, if it was acquired before 20 September 1985)\n\u2022your spouse owned the home that was sold.\n\n\n\n\nIf your home was a pre-CGT asset you can still make a downsizer contribution if would be entitled to such an exemption if your home was a post CGT asset rather than a pre-CGT asset.\n\nIf your home that was sold was only owned by one spouse, the spouse that did not have an ownership interest may also make a downsizer contribution, or have one made on their behalf, provided they meet all of the other requirements\n\nFor more information, see\n[Downsizing contributions into superannuation](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/super-for-individuals-and-families/super/growing-and-keeping-track-of-your-super/how-to-save-more-in-your-super/downsizer-super-contributions)\n.\n\n**What is a dwelling?**\n\nA dwelling is anything that is used wholly or mainly for residential accommodation. Certain mobile homes can also be a dwelling. Examples of a dwelling are:\n\n\n\u2022a home or cottage\n\u2022an apartment or flat\n\u2022a strata title unit\n\u2022a unit in a retirement village\n\u2022a caravan, houseboat or other mobile home.\n\n\n\n\nAny land the dwelling is on is included as part of the dwelling, but it only qualifies for the main residence exemption if the land and the dwelling are sold together. Also, the exemption applies to a maximum of 2 hectares of land (including the land on which the dwelling is built). Any excess is subject to CGT.\n\nA building or a unit in a building, which is a dwelling, ceases to be a dwelling once you commence converting it into commercial premises.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Land adjacent to the dwelling](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATLANDADJACENTTOTHEDWELLING%22&PiT=99991231235958#LANDADJACENTTOTHEDWELLING)\n.\n\n**What is an ownership interest?**\n\nIn the case of a flat or home unit, you have an ownership interest if you have a:\n\n\n\u2022legal or equitable interest in a strata title in the flat or home unit\n\u2022licence or right to occupy the flat or home unit\n\u2022share in a company that owns a legal or equitable interest in the land on which the flat or home unit is constructed and that share gives you a right to occupy the flat or home unit.\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of a dwelling that is not a flat or home unit, you have an ownership interest if you have a:\n\n\n\u2022legal or equitable interest in the land on which it is constructed\n\u2022licence or right to occupy it.\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of land, you have an ownership interest if you have either a:\n\n\n\u2022legal or equitable interest in it\n\u2022right to occupy it.\n\n\n\n\nAn equitable interest may include life tenancy of a dwelling that you acquire, for example, under a deceased's will.\n\n***When do you acquire an ownership interest?***\n\nFor the purposes of the main residence exemption, you have an ownership interest in a dwelling or land you acquire under a contract from the time you get legal ownership (unless you have a right to occupy it at an earlier time).\n\nYou have legal ownership of a dwelling or land from the date of settlement of the contract of purchase (or if you have a right to occupy it at an earlier time, that time) until the date of settlement of the contract of sale. This period is called your ownership period. If the dwelling is on 2 hectares of land or less, is your main residence for the whole of the ownership period and you don't use it to produce assessable income, the home is fully exempt.\n\n**Example 63: full exemption**\n> Frank signed a contract on 14 August 2000 to purchase 0.1 hectare of land from a developer and to have a house constructed on the land. Under the contract, settlement did not occur until construction was completed on 26 October 2001.\n\n> Frank moved into the house immediately upon settlement of the contract he had with the developer, that is, on 26 October 2001. He did not have a right to occupy the house at an earlier time under the purchase contract. He signed the contract to sell it on 25 May 2024 and settlement occurred on 20 July 2024. The house was Frank's main residence for the full period he owned it and he did not use any part of it to produce income.\n\n> For CGT purposes, Frank is taken to have acquired the land on which the house was constructed on the date he entered into the contract, 14 August 2000. However, because the house was Frank's main residence for the whole period between settlement of the purchase contract and settlement of the sale contract, it is fully exempt.\n\n> The period between when Frank entered into the purchase contract and started to live in the house (14 August 2000 to 25 October 2001) is ignored. This is because the relevant dates for the main residence exemption are the settlement dates or, if you had a right under the purchase contract to occupy the dwelling at an earlier time, that time until settlement of the sale contract.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though the settlement dates are used to calculate the period for which the main residence exemption applies, the dates you enter into the purchase and sale contracts are important.\n\nA CGT event occurs when you enter into the sale contract. You include any capital gain in your tax return for the income year in which the CGT event occurs. The dates you enter into the purchase and sale contracts are also relevant for determining what method you can use to work out your capital gain from your main residence.\n\n**Example 64: partial exemption**\n> The facts are the same as in the previous example except that Frank rented out the house from 26 October 2001, the date of settlement of the purchase contract, until 2 March 2003.\n\n> Frank makes a capital gain of $90,000 on the house. To work out the part of the capital gain that is not exempt, Frank must determine how many days in his ownership period the dwelling was not his main residence.\n\n> Frank had an ownership interest in the property from settlement of the purchase contract (26 October 2001) until settlement of the sale contract (20 July 2024), a total of 8,304 days.\n\n> The period between the dates the purchase contract was signed (14 August 2000) and settled (25 October 2001) is ignored. Because the house was not Frank's main residence from 26 October 2001 to 2 March 2003 (493 days), he does not get the exemption for this period.\n\n> Frank calculates his capital gain as follows:\n\n> $90,000 capital gain \u00d7 (493 days \u00f7 8,304 days) = $5,343 taxable portion\n\n> Because Frank entered into the purchase contract after 11:45am AEST on 21 September 1999 and entered into the sale contract after owning the house for at least 12 months, he can reduce his capital gain by the CGT discount of 50% after applying any capital losses.\n\n> Because Frank signed the sale contract on 25 May 2024, the CGT event occurred in the 2023\u201324 income year, even though settlement occurred in the next income year. Frank writes the capital gain on his 2024 tax return.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Is the dwelling your main residence?**\n\nThe following factors may be relevant in working out whether a dwelling is your main residence:\n\n\n\u2022the length of time you live there (there is no minimum time a person has to live in a home before it is considered to be their main residence)\n\u2022whether your family lives there\n\u2022whether you have moved your personal belongings into the home\n\u2022the address to which your mail is delivered\n\u2022your address on the electoral roll\n\u2022the connection of services (for example, phone, gas or electricity)\n\u2022your intention in occupying the dwelling.\n\n\n\n\nA mere intention to construct or occupy a dwelling as your main residence, without actually doing so, is not sufficient to get the exemption.\n\nIf you were not a resident of Australia for tax purposes while you were living in the property you are unlikely to satisfy the requirements for the main residence exemption.\n\nIn certain circumstances, you may choose to treat a dwelling as your main residence even though:\n\n\n\u2022you no longer live in it; for more information, see\n[Continuing main residence status after dwelling ceases to be your main residence](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATSTATUSAFTERDWELLINGCEASESTOBEYOURMAINRESIDENCE%22&PiT=99991231235958#STATUSAFTERDWELLINGCEASESTOBEYOURMAINRESIDENCE)\n\u2022you are yet to live in it, but will do so as soon as practicable after it is constructed, repaired or renovated and you will continue to live in it for at least 3 months; for more information, see\n[Constructing, renovating or repairing a dwelling on land you already own](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCONSTRUCTINGRENOVATINGORREPAIRINGADWELLINGONLANDYOUALREADYOWN%22&PiT=99991231235958#CONSTRUCTINGRENOVATINGORREPAIRINGADWELLINGONLANDYOUALREADYOWN)\n.\n\n\n\n\n**Moving into a dwelling**\n\nA dwelling is considered to be your main residence from the time you acquired your ownership interest in it if you moved into it as soon as practicable after that time. If you purchased the dwelling, this would generally be the date of settlement of the purchase contract. However, if there is a delay in moving in because of illness or other unforeseen circumstances, the exemption may still be available from the time you acquired your ownership interest in the dwelling.\n\nIf you could not move in because the dwelling was being rented to someone, you are not considered to have moved in as soon as practicable after you acquired your ownership interest.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there is a special rule that allows you to treat more than one dwelling as your main residence for a limited time if you are changing main residences, see\n[Moving from one main residence to another](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATMOVINGFROMONEMAINRESIDENCETOANOTHER%22&PiT=99991231235958#MOVINGFROMONEMAINRESIDENCETOANOTHER)\n.\n\n**Example 65: moving in as soon as practicable**\n> Mary signs a contract to buy a townhouse on 1 March 2023. She is to take possession when settlement occurs on 30 April 2023.\n\n> On 11 March 2023, Mary is directed by her employer to go overseas on an assignment for 4 months, leaving on 25 March 2023. Mary moves into the townhouse on her return to Australia in late July 2023.\n\n> Mary's overseas assignment was unforeseen at the time she bought the property. As she moved in as soon as practicable after settlement of the contract occurred, Mary can treat the townhouse as her main residence from the date of settlement until she moved in.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Land adjacent to the dwelling**\n\nThe land adjacent to a dwelling is also exempt if:\n\n\n\u2022during the period you owned it, the land is used mainly for private or domestic purposes in association with the dwelling\n\u2022the total area of the land around the dwelling, including the land on which it stands, is not greater than 2 hectares. If the land used for private purposes is greater than 2 hectares, you can choose which 2 hectares are exempt but the land you choose must include the land on which the dwelling is built.\n\n\n\n\nLand is adjacent to your dwelling if it is close to, near, adjoining or neighbouring the dwelling.\n\nIf you sell any of the land adjacent to your dwelling separately from the dwelling, the land is not exempt. It is only exempt when sold with the dwelling. There is an exception if the dwelling is accidentally destroyed and you sell the vacant land or vacant land adjacent to your dwelling is compulsorily acquired. See:\n\n\n\u2022[Destruction of dwelling and sale of land](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATDESTRUCTIONOFDWELLINGANDSALEOFLAND%22&PiT=99991231235958#DESTRUCTIONOFDWELLINGANDSALEOFLAND)\n\u2022[Compulsory acquisition of part of your main residence](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCOMPULSORYACQUISITIONOFPARTOFYOURMAINRESIDENCE%22&PiT=99991231235958#COMPULSORYACQUISITIONOFPARTOFYOURMAINRESIDENCE)\n.\n\n\n\n\nAny part of the land around a dwelling used to produce income is not exempt, even if the total land is less than 2 hectares. However, the dwelling and any buildings and other land used in association with it remain exempt if you do not use them to produce income.\n\n**Example 66: land used for private purposes**\n> Tim bought a home with 15 hectares of land in November 2001. He uses 10 hectares of the land to produce income and 5 hectares for private purposes. Tim can get the main residence exemption for the home and 2 hectares of land he selects out of the 5 hectares that are used for private purposes.\n\n> Tim gets a valuation which states that the home and 2 hectares of land that he has selected are worth two-thirds of the total value of the property. The relative values of the different parts of the property remained the same between the time of purchase and the time of sale.\n\n> Tim entered into a contract to sell the property on 8 May 2024. The capital gain from the property is $150,000. Tim may claim the main residence exemption on the two-thirds of the capital gain attributable to the house and 2 hectares of land, that is, $100,000.\n\n> Because he entered into the contract to acquire the property after 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999 and owned it for at least 12 months, Tim reduces his remaining $50,000 gain (attributable to the land) by the CGT discount of 50% after applying any capital losses.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Other structures associated with the dwelling**\n\nA flat or home unit often includes areas (for example, a laundry, storeroom or garage) that are physically separate from the flat or home unit. As long as you use these areas primarily for private or domestic purposes in association with the flat or home unit for the whole period you own it, they are exempt on the same basis that the flat or home unit is exempt.\n\nHowever, if you dispose of one of these structures separately from the flat or home unit, they are not exempt. If one of these structures is compulsorily acquired without your flat or home unit also being acquired, see\n[Compulsory acquisition of part of your main residence](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCOMPULSORYACQUISITIONOFPARTOFYOURMAINRESIDENCE%22&PiT=99991231235958#COMPULSORYACQUISITIONOFPARTOFYOURMAINRESIDENCE)\n.\n\n**Partial exemption for main residence**\n\nIf a CGT event happens to a dwelling you acquired on or after 20 September 1985 and that dwelling was not your main residence for the whole time you owned it, you get only a partial exemption.\n\nYou calculate the part of the capital gain that is taxable as follows:\n\n`A \u00d7 (B \u00f7 C)`\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\u2022A is total capital gain made from the CGT event\n\u2022B is number of days in your ownership period when the dwelling was not your main residence\n\u2022C is total number of days in your ownership period\n\n\n**Example 67: main residence for part of the ownership period**\n> Andrew bought a house on 1 hectare of land under a contract that was settled on 1 July 1991 and moved in immediately.

You must apply it on the assumption that you did borrow money to acquire the dwelling.\n\nIf you rent out part of your home, you would be entitled to deduct part of the interest if you had borrowed money to acquire the dwelling.\n\nIf you run a business or professional practice in part of your home, you would be entitled to deduct part of the interest on money you borrowed to acquire the dwelling if:\n\n\n\u2022part of the dwelling is set aside exclusively as a place of business and is clearly identifiable as such\n\u2022that part of the home is not readily adaptable for private use, for example, a doctor's surgery located within the doctor's home.\n\n\n\n\nYou would not be entitled to deduct any interest expenses if, for convenience, you use a home study to undertake work usually done at your place of work. Similarly, you would not be entitled to deduct interest expenses if you do paid child-minding at home (unless a special part of the home was set aside exclusively for that purpose). In these situations, you could still get a full main residence exemption.\n\n**Example 68: renting out part of a home**\n> Thomas purchased a home under a contract that was settled on 1 July 1999 and sold it under a contract that was settled on 30 June 2024. The home was his main residence for the entire time.\n\n> Throughout the period Thomas owned the home, a tenant rented one bedroom, which represented 20% of the home. Both Thomas and the tenant used the living room, bathroom, laundry and kitchen, which represented 30% of the home. Only Thomas used the remainder of the home. Therefore, Thomas would be entitled to a 35% deduction for interest if he had incurred it on money borrowed to acquire his home.

Nor can you include interest in the cost base if you are entitled to a deduction but don't claim it.\n\nYou can still get a full main residence exemption if someone else uses part of your home to produce income and you receive no income from that person.\n\nWhen a CGT event happens to the home, the proportion of the capital gain or capital loss that is taxable is an amount that is reasonable according to the extent to which you would have been able to deduct the interest on money borrowed to acquire the home.\n\nIn most cases, this is the proportion of the floor area of the home that is set aside to produce income and the period you use the home to produce income. This includes if the dwelling is available (for example, advertised) for rent.\n\n**Example 69: running a business in part of a home for part of the period of ownership**\n> Ruth entered into a contract to buy her home that settled before 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999.

Therefore, their old home is treated as their main residence only for the period before settlement of their new home and during the last 6 months before settlement of the sale of the old home.\n\n> The 90 days from 1 January 2023 to 31 March 2023, when the old home was not their main residence, are taken into account in calculating the proportion of their capital gain that is taxable (90 \u00f7 8,675).\n\n> Because they entered into the contract to acquire their old home after 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999 and entered into the contract to sell it after they had held it for at least 12 months, Jeneen and John can use the discount method to calculate their capital gain.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it takes longer than 6 months to dispose of your old home, you may get an exemption for the old home for the period in excess of the 6 months by choosing to treat it as your main residence for that period under the 'continuing main residence status after dwelling ceases to be your main residence' rule. If you do this, you get only a partial exemption when you dispose of your new home.\n\n**Example 75: partial exemption for new home**\n> The facts are the same as in the previous example, except that Jeneen and John choose to continue to treat their old home as their main residence for the period from 1 January 2023 to 31 March 2023 under the\n> [continuing main residence status after dwelling ceases to be your main residence](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATSTATUSAFTERDWELLINGCEASESTOBEYOURMAINRESIDENCE%22&PiT=99991231235958#STATUSAFTERDWELLINGCEASESTOBEYOURMAINRESIDENCE)\n> rule.\n\n> This means they get a full exemption when they sell it.\n\n> Because both homes can only be exempt for a maximum of 6 months when you are moving from one to the other, Jeneen and John will not get a full exemption for their new home when they sell it. The exemption would not be available for the new home for the 90 days from 1 January 2023 to 31 March 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Status after dwelling ceases to be your main residence**\n\nIn some cases, you can choose to treat a dwelling as your main residence even though you no longer live in it.

Later, she stopped renting it out and moved in.\n\n> Therese can't choose to treat the house as her main residence during the period she was absent under the continuing main residence rule, because the house was not her main residence before she rented it out. She will only be entitled to a partial exemption if she sells the dwelling.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis choice needs to be made only for the income year that the CGT event happens to the dwelling, for example, the year that you enter into a contract to sell it. If you own both:\n\n\n\u2022the dwelling that you can choose to treat as your main residence after you no longer live in it\n\u2022the dwelling you actually lived in during that period\n\n\n-you make the choice for the income year you enter into the contract to sell the first of those dwellings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you make this choice, you can't treat any other dwelling as your main residence for that period (except for a limited time if you are changing main residences, see\n[Moving from one main residence to another](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATMOVINGFROMONEMAINRESIDENCETOANOTHER%22&PiT=99991231235958#MOVINGFROMONEMAINRESIDENCETOANOTHER)\n).\n\nIf you don't use it to produce income (for example, you leave it vacant or use it as a holiday home) you can treat the dwelling as your main residence for an unlimited period after you stop living in it.\n\nIf you do use it to produce income (for example, you rent it out or it is available for rent) you can choose to treat it as your main residence for up to 6 years after you stop living in it (see\nexample 72\n).

During this period, she rented it out for 6 years and left it vacant for 4 years.\n\n> Lisa chooses to treat the dwelling as her main residence for the period after she stopped living in it, so she disregards any capital gain or capital loss she makes on the sale of the dwelling. The maximum period the dwelling can continue to be her main residence while she used it to produce income is 6 years. However, while the house is vacant, the period she can treat the dwelling as her main residence is unlimited. This means the exemption applies for the whole 10 years that she was absent from the dwelling.\n\n> As the dwelling is fully exempt because Lisa made the choice to treat the dwelling as her main residence, the\n> [home first used to produce income](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATHOMEFIRSTUSEDTOPRODUCEINCOME%22&PiT=99991231235958#HOMEFIRSTUSEDTOPRODUCEINCOME)\n> rule does not apply.\n\n> The maximum period that Lisa can treat the dwelling as her main residence whilst it was being used to produce income is a total of 6 years even if the period the dwelling was income producing was broken by a period of vacancy. For example, if Lisa rented the dwelling for 4 years, left it vacant for 3 years and rented for 3 years, she could only treat the dwelling as her main residence for 9 of the 10 years that she was not living there.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can choose when you want to stop the period covered by this choice.\n\nFor information on when and how you make a choice, see\n[Choices](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCHOICES%22&PiT=99991231235958#CHOICES)\n.\n\n**Example 78: choosing to stop the period covered by the choice early**\n> James bought his home in Brisbane on 1 July 2003 and moved in immediately.

As it was Kathy's main residence and she owned 50% of it, she disregards her share of any capital gain or capital loss for the period she and Grahame had different homes (1 May 2002 to 15 April 2024).\n\n> As Grahame did not live in the beach house or nominate it as his main residence when he and Kathy had different homes, he does not ignore his share of any capital gain or capital loss for any of the period he owned it.\n\n> Grahame and Kathy also sold the townhouse, under a contract that was settled on 15 April 2024.\n\n> Because Grahame owns more than 50% of the townhouse, it is taken to have been his main residence for half of the period when he and Kathy had different homes.\n\n> If the total capital gain on the sale of the townhouse is $100,000, Grahame's share of the capital gain is $70,000 (reflecting his 70% ownership interest). The amount of the gain that Grahame disregards under the main residence exemption is worked out as follows:\n> \n> `$70,000 \u00d7 (1,035 days [see\n> note 1\n> ] \u00f7 9,056 days [see\n> note 2\n> ]) = $8,000`\n\n> *Add*\n> \n> `$70,000 \u00d7 50% \u00d7 (8,021 days [see\n> note 3\n> ] \u00f7 9,056 days [see\n> note 2\n> ]) = $31,000`\n\n> **Note 1:**\n> townhouse was Grahame's home and he and Kathy didn't have different homes (1 July 1999 to 30 April 2002)\n\n> **Note 2:**\n> total ownership period (1 July 1999 to 15 April 2024)\n\n> **Note 3:**\n> when Grahame and Kathy had the different homes (1 May 2002 to 15 April 2024)\n\n> The total amount disregarded by Grahame is:\n> \n> `$8,000 + $31,000 = $39,000`\n\n> As Grahame bought the townhouse before 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999 and entered into the contract to sell it after owning his share for at least 12 months, he can use either the indexation or the discount method to calculate his capital gain.\n\n> Kathy's share of the $100,000 capital gain on the townhouse is $30,000, reflecting her 30% ownership interest. The amount she disregards is:\n> \n> `$30,000 \u00d7 (1,035 days [see\n> note 4\n> ] \u00f7 9,056 days [see\n> note 5\n> ]) = $3,429`\n\n> **Note 4:**\n> period before 1 May 2002 when the townhouse was Kathy's home\n\n> **Note 5:**\n> total ownership period (1 July 1999 to 15 April 2024)\n\n> As Kathy entered into the contract to buy the townhouse before 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999 and entered into the contract to sell it after owning her share for at least 12 months, she can use either the discount method to calculate her capital gain or the indexation method.\n\n\n\n**Example 84: different main residences**\n> Anna and her spouse, Mark, jointly purchased a townhouse under a contract that was settled on 5 February 2000. They both lived in it from that date until 29 April 2024, when the contract of sale was settled. Anna owned more than 50% of the townhouse.\n\n> Before 5 February 2000, Anna had lived alone in her own flat, which she rented out after moving to the townhouse.

He will not get an exemption for the townhouse for the period that he nominated Anna's flat as his main residence (that is, 5 February 2000 to 11 March 2001).\n\n> If Mark nominates the townhouse as his main residence, he qualifies for a full exemption on any capital gain he makes when it is sold because he owned 50% or less of it. However, because Mark and Anna have different main residences as a result of Mark's choice, and Anna owns more than 50% of the flat, her gain on the flat will only qualify for a 50% exemption for the period from 5 February 2000 to 11 March 2001.\n\n> Any capital gain Anna makes on the townhouse is taxable, except for the period from 12 March 2001 to 29 April 2024 and the part that is ignored under the\n> [moving from one main residence to another](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATMOVINGFROMONEMAINRESIDENCETOANOTHER%22&PiT=99991231235958#MOVINGFROMONEMAINRESIDENCETOANOTHER)\n> rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Major capital improvements to a dwelling acquired before 20 September 1985**\n\nIf you acquired a dwelling before 20 September 1985 and you make major capital improvements after that date, part of any capital gain you make when a CGT event happens to the dwelling could be taxable. Even though you acquired the dwelling before CGT started, major capital improvements are considered to be separate CGT assets from the original asset, and may therefore be subject to CGT in their own right if you make them on or after 20 September 1985.\n\nIf the dwelling is your main residence and you use the improvements as part of your home, they are still exempt. This includes improvements on land adjacent to the dwelling (for example, installing a swimming pool) if the total land, including the land on which the home stands, is 2 hectares or less.\n\nHowever, if the dwelling is not your main residence or you used the improvements to produce income for any period, the part of any gain that is attributable to the improvements for that period is taxable.\n\nA capital improvement to an existing structure, such as a renovation to your house, is taken to be major if its original cost (indexed for inflation if the improvements were made under a contract entered into before 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999) is:\n\n\n\u2022more than 5% of the amount you receive when you dispose of the dwelling, and\n\u2022greater than a certain threshold. The threshold increases every income year to take account of inflation. Improvement thresholds for 1985\u201386 to 2023\u201324 are shown in\n[table 1](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATTABLE1%22&PiT=99991231235958#TABLE1)\n.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you dispose of the dwelling, you calculate the capital gain or capital loss on the major improvements by taking away the cost base of the improvements from the proceeds of the sale that are reasonably attributable to the improvements:\n\n`A = B - C`\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\u2022A is capital gain on major improvements\n\u2022B is proceeds of sale attributable to improvements\n\u2022C is cost base of improvements\n\n\n\n\nYou can choose to calculate the capital gain made on the improvements using either the indexation or the discount method if:\n\n\n\u2022the improvements were made under a contract entered into at or before 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999\n\u2022the dwelling was sold after that time, and\n\u2022you owned the improvements for at least 12 months.\n\n\n\n\nIf you entered into the contract to make the improvements after 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999 and you owned them for more than 12 months, you can calculate your capital gain using the CGT discount of 50%.\n\nIn calculating the amount of capital proceeds to be attributed to the improvements, you must take whatever steps are appropriate to work out their value. If you make an estimate of this amount, it must be reasonable and you must be able to show how you arrived at the estimated amount.\n\n**Example 85: improvement to a dwelling acquired before 20 September 1985**\n> Martin bought a home in 1984. On 1 December 1989, he undertook major renovations to his home, costing $150,000. He sold the home for $500,000 under a contract that was settled on 1 December 2023. At the date of sale, the indexed cost base of the improvements was $186,750.\n\n> Of the $500,000 he received for the home, $200,000 could be attributed to the improvements. Martin used the improvements to produce income from the time they were finished until the time he sold them with the home.\n\n> The\n> [home first used to produce income](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATHOMEFIRSTUSEDTOPRODUCEINCOME%22&PiT=99991231235958#HOMEFIRSTUSEDTOPRODUCEINCOME)\n> rule does not apply to the improvements because they were first used to produce income before 21 August 1996.\n\n> The cost base of the improvements is more than 5% of the $500,000 capital proceeds (that is, $25,000) and more than the 2023\u201324 threshold of $174,465. Therefore, because the improvements were used to produce income, the capital gain on the improvements is taxable. (Because the improvements were made under a contract entered into before 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999 the indexed cost base can be used.)\n\n> As Martin acquired the improvements before 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999 and sold the home after he had held the improvements for at least 12 months, he could use either the indexation method or the discount method to calculate his capital gain on the improvements.\n\n> Martin calculates his capital gain using the indexation method as follows:\n\n> 1. Amount of proceeds attributable to the improvements is $200,000.\n\n> 2.\n> *Subtract*\n> cost base of improvements indexed for inflation of $186,750.\n\n> 3. Total\n> **taxable capital gain is $13,250.**\n\n> Martin's capital gain using the discount method (assuming he has no capital losses or other capital gains in the 2023\u201324 income year and does not have any unapplied net capital losses from earlier years) is:\n\n> 1. Amount of proceeds attributable to the improvements is $200,000.\n\n> 2.\n> *Subtract*\n> cost base of improvements (without indexation) of $150,000.\n\n> 3. Equals a capital gain of $50,000.\n\n> 4.\n> *Subtract*\n> 50% discount of $25,000.\n\n> 5. The\n> **net capital gain is $25,000.**\n\n> Martin chooses the indexation method because this gives him a lower capital gain.\n\n> **Note:**\n> If the improvements had been used as part of Martin's main residence, this gain would be exempt. However, if the home (including the improvements) had been rented out for one-third of the period, one-third of the capital gain made on the improvements would have been taxable.\n\n> If construction of the improvements started after 13 May 1997 and they were used to produce income, Martin would also reduce the cost base by the amount of any capital works deductions he claimed or can claim, see\n> [Cost base adjustments for capital works deductions](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCOSTBASEADJUSTMENTSFORCAPITALWORKSDEDUCTIONS%22&PiT=99991231235958#COSTBASEADJUSTMENTSFORCAPITALWORKSDEDUCTIONS)\n> . If Martin makes a capital loss, the reduced cost base of the improvements is reduced by the amount of any capital works deductions irrespective of when construction started.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Buildings or structures constructed on land acquired before 20 September 1985**\n\nBuildings or structures constructed on or after 20 September 1985 on land acquired before that date are also considered to be separate CGT assets from the original land.

Therefore, they may be subject to CGT if you use them other than as your main residence.\n\n**Dwellings transferred after marriage or relationship breakdown**\n\nSpecial rules apply to dwellings transferred to you from a spouse, or a company or trustee of a trust, if the marriage or relationship breakdown rollover applies.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Real estate and main residence](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATREALESTATEANDMAINRESIDENCE%22&PiT=99991231235958#REALESTATEANDMAINRESIDENCE)\n.\n\n**Inherited main residence**\n\nIf you inherit a deceased person's dwelling, you may be exempt or partially exempt when a CGT event happens to it. The same exemptions apply if a CGT event happens to a deceased's estate of which you are the trustee.\n[Flowchart 3.6](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATFLOWCHART3.6%22&PiT=99991231235958#FLOWCHART3.6)\nin\n**appendix 3**\nsets out the full exemption rules if you inherit a dwelling.

The main residence exemption means you may not pay CGT on any capital gain made after you sell or dispose of the inherited property, depending on the use of the property by both you and the deceased.\n\nIf you inherit an Australian residential property from a deceased person who had been a foreign resident for more than 6 years at the time of their death, any main residence exemption that the deceased person may have accrued for that dwelling is not available to you. This means you may have to pay CGT when you sell or dispose of the property.\n\nIf you inherit an Australian residential property and you have been a foreign resident for more than 6 years when you sell or dispose of the property, you can't claim the main residence exemption for your ownership period.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Foreign residents and inherited property](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/capital-gains-tax/inherited-assets-and-capital-gains-tax/inherited-property-and-cgt)\n.\n\n***Full exemption***\n\nA full exemption will be applied depending on when the deceased died and when they acquired the property.\n\n*Deceased died before 20 September 1985*\n\nAs you acquired the dwelling before 20 September 1985, any capital gain you make is exempt. However, major capital improvements you make to the dwelling on or after 20 September 1985 may be taxable, see\n[Major capital improvements to a dwelling acquired before 20 September 1985](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATMAJORCAPITALIMPROVEMENTSTOADWELLINGACQUIREDBEFORE20SEPTEMBER1985%22&PiT=99991231235958#MAJORCAPITALIMPROVEMENTSTOADWELLINGACQUIREDBEFORE20SEPTEMBER1985)\n.\n\n*Deceased died on or after 20 September 1985*\n\n**A.**\nThe deceased acquired the dwelling\n**before**\n20 September 1985 (it does not matter whether the dwelling was the main residence of the deceased person).\n\nYou may have an ownership interest in a dwelling that passed to you as a beneficiary in a deceased estate or you may have owned it as trustee of a deceased estate. In either case, you disregard any capital gain or capital loss you make from a CGT event that happens to the dwelling if either of the following 2 conditions applies.\n\n\n1.You disposed of your ownership interest within 2 years of the person's death, that is, if the dwelling was sold under a contract, settlement occurred within 2 years. This exemption applies whether or not you used the dwelling as your main residence or to produce income during the 2-year period.

When she died on 17 November 1999, the house became the main residence of her beneficiary, Lesley. Lesley sold the property under a contract that was settled on 27 November 2023.\n\n> As Vicki had never used the property as her main residence, Lesley can't claim a full exemption from CGT. However, as Lesley used the house as her main residence, she is entitled to a partial exemption from CGT.\n\n> Vicki owned the house for 1,375 days and Lesley then lived in the house for 8,776 days, a total of 10,151 days. Assuming Lesley made a capital gain of $100,000, the taxable portion is:\n> \n> `$100,000 \u00d7 (1,375 \u00f7 10,151) = $13,545`\n\n> In working out her capital gain, Lesley can use either the discount method or the indexation method. This is because, for the purposes of using those methods, she is taken to have acquired the property on 12 February 1996 (when Vicki acquired it) and this is before 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999, and more than 12 months before Lesley entered into the contract to sell it.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you dispose of your ownership interest in a dwelling within 2 years of the person's death, you can ignore the main residence days and total days in the period from the person's death until you dispose of the dwelling if this lessens your tax liability. See\n[Commissioner may extend the 2-year time period](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%22&PiT=99991231235958#GCGT)\n.\n\nYou also ignore any non-main residence days before the deceased's death in calculating the capital gain or capital loss if:\n\n\n\u2022you acquired the dwelling after 20 August 1996\n\u2022the dwelling was the deceased's main residence just before their death\n\u2022the dwelling was not being used to produce income at the time of their death, and\n\u2022the deceased was not a foreign resident for a continuous period of more than 6 years just before the deceased's death.\n\n\n\n\n***Using a home you inherited to produce income***\n\nIf a person acquired their main residence on or after 20 September 1985, and they died and it passed to you as a beneficiary (or as trustee of their estate) after 20 August 1996, you are taken to have acquired the dwelling at its market value at the time you first used it to produce your income if:\n\n\n\u2022you first used the dwelling to produce income after 20 August 1996\n\u2022when a CGT event happens to the dwelling, you would get only a partial exemption because you used the dwelling to produce assessable income during the period you owned it\n\u2022you would have been entitled to a full exemption if the CGT event happened to the dwelling immediately before you first used it to produce income\n\u2022the CGT event did not happen to the dwelling within 2 years of the person's date of death.\n\n\n\n\nIf all of the above apply, you must work out your capital gain or capital loss using the market value of the dwelling at the time you first used it to produce income. You don't have a choice.\n\n***Cost to you of acquiring the dwelling***\n\nIf you acquire a dwelling the deceased had owned, there are special rules for calculating your cost base.\n\nThese rules apply in calculating any capital gain or capital loss when a CGT event happens to the dwelling.\n\nThe first element of the cost base and reduced cost base of a dwelling (its acquisition cost) is its market value at the date of death if either:\n\n\n\u2022the dwelling was acquired by the deceased before 20 September 1985\n\u2022the dwelling passes to you after 20 August 1996 (but not as a joint tenant), and it was the main residence of the deceased immediately before their death and was not being used to produce income at that date.\n\n\n\n\nIn any other case, your acquisition cost is the deceased's cost base and reduced cost base on the day they died. You may need to contact the trustee or the deceased's recognised tax adviser to obtain the details. If that cost base includes indexation, you must recalculate it to exclude the indexation component if you prefer to use the discount method to work out your capital gain from the property.\n\nIf you are a beneficiary, the cost base and the reduced cost base also include amounts that the trustee of the deceased's estate would have been able to include in the cost base and reduced cost base.\n\n***Continuing main residence status***\n\nIf the deceased was not living in the home at the date of their death, they or their trustee may have chosen to continue to treat it as their main residence. You may need to contact the trustee or the deceased's recognised tax adviser to find out whether this choice was made. If it was, the dwelling can still be regarded as the deceased's main residence:\n\n\n\u2022for an indefinite period, if the dwelling was not used to produce income after the deceased stopped living in it, or\n\u2022for a maximum of 6 years after they stopped living in it, if it was used to produce income after they stopped living in it.\n\n\n**Example 88: continuing main residence status**\n> Aldo bought a house in March 1996 and lived in it.\n\n> He moved into a nursing home in December 2018 and left the house vacant.

The house would be considered to be his main residence until his death because he rented it out for less than 6 years.\n\n> If this choice had been made, Con would get an exemption for the period Aldo owned the house.\n\n\n\n\n\n***Commissioner may extend the 2-year time period***\n\nA trustee or beneficiary of a deceased estate may apply to the Commissioner for an\n[extension of the 2-year time period](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/capital-gains-tax/inherited-assets-and-capital-gains-tax/inherited-property-and-cgt/extensions-to-the-2-year-ownership-period#Extendingthe2yearlimit)\n, where the CGT event happened in 2008\u201309 or later. Generally, the Commissioner would exercise the discretion in situations where the delay is due to circumstances which are outside of the control of the beneficiary or trustee, for example:\n\n\n\u2022the ownership of a dwelling or a will is challenged\n\u2022the complexity of a deceased estate delays the completion of administration of the estate\n\u2022a trustee or beneficiary is unable to attend to the deceased estate due to unforeseen or serious personal circumstances arising during the 2-year period (for example, the taxpayer or a family member has a severe illness or injury), or\n\u2022settlement of a contract of sale over the dwelling is unexpectedly delayed or falls through for circumstances outside the beneficiary or trustee's control.\n\n\n\n\nThese examples are not exhaustive.\n\nIn exercising the discretion, the Commissioner will also take into account whether and to what extent the dwelling is used to produce assessable income and for how long the trustee or beneficiary held the ownership interest in the dwelling.\n\nIn certain circumstances you may be eligible to use the safe harbour to extend the 2\u2013year period without having to apply to the Commissioner to exercise discretion. For more information, see\n[Extensions to the 2-year ownership period](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/capital-gains-tax/inherited-assets-and-capital-gains-tax/inherited-property-and-cgt/extensions-to-the-2-year-ownership-period)\n.\n\n**Inheriting a dwelling from someone who inherited it themselves**\n\nThe formula for calculating the partial main residence exemption is adjusted if the deceased individual also acquired the interest in the dwelling on or after 20 September 1985 as a beneficiary (or trustee) of a deceased estate. The main residence exemption is calculated having regard to the number of days the dwelling was the main residence of yourself and the previous beneficiaries.\n\n**Example 89: partial exemption for beneficiaries**\n> Ahmed acquired a dwelling after 20 September 1985.\n\n> The dwelling was his main residence from the date of settlement of the contract for purchase until he died. The number of days Ahmed owned the dwelling was 3,700.\n\n> Under his will, Ahmed left the dwelling to his son, Fayez. Fayez was the sole beneficiary of Ahmed's estate. No other individual had a right to occupy the dwelling under Ahmed's will.\n\n> Some years later, Fayez died. He had owned the dwelling for 2,600 days and it wasn't his main residence at any time during this period.\n\n> The dwelling was left to Mardianah under Fayez's will.\n\n> Mardianah sold the dwelling in 2023\u201324 and made a capital gain of $100,000. She owned the dwelling for 750 days and it wasn't her main residence at any time during that period.\n\n> The taxable proportion of Mardianah's $100,000 capital gain is $47,518. This is worked out as follows:\n> \n> `$100,000 \u00d7 (2,600 + 750) \u00f7 (2,600 + 750 + 3,700) = $47,518`\n\n> Because the combined period that Ahmed, Fayez and Mardianah owned the dwelling was more than 12 months, Mardianah can reduce her $47,518 capital gain by the 50% discount (after deducting any capital losses).\n\n> Because Mardianah gets an exemption for the period the dwelling was Ahmed's main residence, her capital gain is less than it otherwise would have been.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, see\n[Deceased estates](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATDECEASEDESTATES%22&PiT=99991231235958#DECEASEDESTATES)\n.\n\n**Death during construction**\n\nIf an individual entered into a contract to construct, repair or renovate a home on land they already owned, and they die before certain conditions are met, the trustee may choose to have the home and land treated as the deceased's main residence for up to 4 years before the home became (or was to become) their main residence.\n\nThe trustee can make this choice if the deceased dies before:\n\n\n\u2022the home is finished\n\u2022it was practicable for the home to be their main residence\n\u2022they had lived in the home for 3 months.\n\n\n\n\nIf the trustee makes this choice, no other dwelling can be treated as the deceased's main residence during that time.\n\nIf the trustee of a deceased estate disposes of residential property in Australia that was owned by a foreign resident, the trustee may no longer be entitled to claim the main residence exemption for the deceased's ownership period.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Main residence exemption for foreign residents](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/capital-gains-tax/foreign-residents-and-capital-gains-tax/main-residence-exemption-for-foreign-residents)\n.\n\n### Loss, destruction or compulsory acquisition of an asset\n\nExplains your CGT obligations if your CGT asset is lost, destroyed or compulsorily acquired.\n\n**On this page**\n\n\n\u2022[Rollover concession](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATROLLOVERCONCESSION%22&PiT=99991231235958#ROLLOVERCONCESSION)\n\u2022[Compulsory acquisition of part of your main residence](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCOMPULSORYACQUISITIONOFPARTOFYOURMAINRESIDENCE%22&PiT=99991231235958#COMPULSORYACQUISITIONOFPARTOFYOURMAINRESIDENCE)\n\u2022[Time of the CGT event](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATTIMEOFTHECGTEVENT2%22&PiT=99991231235958#TIMEOFTHECGTEVENT2)\n\u2022[If you receive money](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATIFYOURECEIVEMONEY%22&PiT=99991231235958#IFYOURECEIVEMONEY)\n\u2022[If you receive an asset](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATIFYOURECEIVEANASSET%22&PiT=99991231235958#IFYOURECEIVEANASSET)\n\u2022[If you receive both money and an asset](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATIFYOURECEIVEBOTHMONEYANDANASSET%22&PiT=99991231235958#IFYOURECEIVEBOTHMONEYANDANASSET)\n\u2022[Indexation or CGT discount](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATINDEXATIONORCGTDISCOUNT%22&PiT=99991231235958#INDEXATIONORCGTDISCOUNT)\n\u2022[Main residence \u2013 compulsory acquisition](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATMAINRESIDENCECOMPULSORYACQUISITION%22&PiT=99991231235958#MAINRESIDENCECOMPULSORYACQUISITION)\n\n\n\n\n**Rollover concession**\n\nGenerally, there are no CGT obligations for assets acquired before 20 September 1985 (pre-CGT).\n\nThere may be a situation where you receive money or another CGT asset (or both) as compensation when you dispose of an asset involuntarily (or under an insurance policy against the risk of such an event happening). In this case, you may be able to choose to:\n\n\n\u2022defer your liability to pay tax on any capital gain arising on the disposal, or\n\u2022get a CGT exemption for any replacement asset if you acquired the original asset before 20 September 1985.\n\n\n\n\nThis concession is known as a rollover. It may be available if one of the following events happens:\n\n\n\u2022All or part of your CGT asset is lost or destroyed for example because it was destroyed by a bushfire or cyclone.\n\u2022Your CGT asset is compulsorily acquired by an Australian Government agency.\n\u2022Your CGT asset is compulsorily acquired by an entity (other than by an Australian Government agency or a foreign government agency) under a power of compulsory acquisition conferred by an Australian or foreign law. However, the compulsory acquisition of minority interests (such as shares in a company) under the Corporations Act or similar foreign law are excluded.\n\u2022You dispose of your CGT asset to an entity (other than a foreign government agency) after a notice is served on you inviting you to negotiate a sale agreement. You must have been informed that, if the negotiations are unsuccessful, the asset will be compulsorily acquired under a power of compulsory acquisition conferred by an Australian or foreign law. However, the compulsory acquisition of minority interests (such as shares in a company) under the Corporations Act or similar foreign law are excluded.\n\u2022You dispose of land to an entity (other than a foreign government agency) where a mining lease was compulsorily granted over the land, the lease significantly affected your use of the land, the lease was in force immediately before the disposal and the entity to which you disposed of the land was the lessee.\n\u2022You dispose of land to an entity (other than a foreign government agency) where a mining lease would have been compulsorily granted over the land, the lease would have significantly affected your use of the land and the entity to which you disposed of the land would have been the lessee.\n\u2022A lease that had been granted to you by an Australian Government agency under a Commonwealth, state or territory law expires and is not renewed.\n\n\n\n\nThis rollover is not available for plant disposed of after 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999 and other depreciating assets from 1 July 2001. Instead, if a depreciating asset is lost or destroyed or, acquired compulsorily or by forced negotiation (other than by a foreign government agency), the capital allowances provisions may allow for a balancing adjustment offset.\n\nThis means that rather than including an amount in your assessable income by way of a balancing adjustment, you can offset that amount against the cost of a replacement asset (or assets).\n\nIf you choose to take rollover, you don't need to lodge a written election stating your choice, it will be clear from the way you prepare your tax return.\n\nYou can't choose to defer a capital loss but you can use it to reduce any capital gain made in the current income year or a later income year.\n\nFor rollover relief to apply, the replacement asset you receive can't be a car, motorcycle or similar vehicle.\n\nFrom 1 July 2001, for rollover relief to apply, the replacement asset you receive can't become an item of your trading stock, nor can it be a depreciating asset.\n\n**Compulsory acquisition of part of your main residence**\n\nFor certain compulsory acquisitions, an optional rollover may apply to a particular arrangement to which the exemption for part of a main residence also applies. The rollover may apply to that arrangement to the extent that the compulsory acquisition exemption doesn't apply.\n\nA compulsory acquisition of part of your main residence may not qualify for the rollover as the requirement that you acquire a replacement asset that is used for the same (or a similar) purpose may not be able to be met. For example, if vacant land adjacent to your home is compulsorily acquired, you may not be able to acquire replacement adjacent land.\n\nIn this case, the main residence exemption may apply to the compulsory acquisition (or similar arrangement) of part of your main residence such as vacant land or structures.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Main residence \u2013 compulsory acquisition](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATMAINRESIDENCECOMPULSORYACQUISITION%22&PiT=99991231235958#MAINRESIDENCECOMPULSORYACQUISITION)\n\n**Time of the CGT event**\n\nYou need to know the time of a CGT event to work out in which income year a capital gain or capital loss affects your income tax.\n\nIf an asset is lost or destroyed and you receive compensation, the time of the CGT event is when you first receive the compensation. For example, if the asset is destroyed in a disaster and you receive an insurance pay out the time of the CGT event is when you receive the insurance payout.\n\nIf you don't receive any compensation, the time of the CGT event is when the loss is discovered or the destruction occurred.\n\nIf your asset was compulsorily acquired by an entity under an Australian law or foreign law, the time of the CGT event is the earliest of when:\n\n\n\u2022you first received compensation from the entity\n\u2022the entity became the asset's owner\n\u2022the entity enters the asset (for example, land) or takes possession of it.\n\n\n\n\nIf an entity acquires your asset following negotiation (rather than compulsorily acquiring it), the time of the CGT event is:\n\n\n\u2022the date the contract to acquire it is made, or\n\u2022the date of the change of ownership if there is no contract.\n\n\n\n\nIf a lease that had been granted to you by an Australian government agency expires and is not renewed, the time of the CGT event is when the lease expires.\n\n**If you receive money**\n\nIf you receive money because a CGT event happens, you can choose a rollover only if:\n\n\n\u2022you incur expenditure in acquiring another CGT asset that is used\n\n\n-in your business or is installed ready for use in the business for a reasonable period if the original asset was a business asset, or\n-otherwise, for a reasonable period for the same or a similar purpose as the original asset, or\n\n\n\n\u2022part of the original asset is lost or destroyed and you incur expenditure of a capital nature in repairing or restoring it.\n\n\n\n\nYou must incur at least some of the expenditure:\n\n\n\u2022no earlier than one year before the event happens, or\n\u2022within one year after the end of the income year in which the event happens.\n\n\n\n\nThis period may be extended in special circumstances.\n\n**Example 90: rollover applies**\n> Trish paid for the repair of an asset in January 2024, for which she was compensated after part of it was destroyed on 1 September 2023. Trish received an insurance payout as compensation for the damage to her asset on 12 December 2023. Her capital expenditure qualifies for the rollover concession because it was incurred between 13 December 2022 to 30 June 2025.\n\n> The replacement asset need not be identical to the one it is replacing. However, for a rollover to apply, you must use it in the same business (or for the same or a similar purpose) as the one for which you used the original asset. Also, your replacement asset can't become an item of trading stock, nor can it be a depreciating asset.\n\n\n\n**Example 91: rollover does not apply**\n> Denise receives money when her manufacturing business premises are destroyed. She buys a rental property with this money.\n\n> Denise can't access the rollover concession because she does not use the rental property for the same or similar purpose as her old business premises.\n\n\n\n\n\n***Consequences of receiving money***\n\nIf you receive money (for example an insurance payout) and choose to take a rollover, the consequences depend on whether you acquired the original asset:\n\n\n1.before 20 September 1985\n2.on or after 20 September 1985, and\n\n\n1.the money received for the asset is more than the cost of repair or replacement\n2.the money received does not exceed the cost of repair or replacement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**1. Original asset acquired before 20 September 1985**\n\nIf you acquired the original asset before 20 September 1985, you are taken to have acquired the repaired or replacement asset before that day if:\n\n\n\u2022you repair or restore the original asset, or\n\u2022you replace the original asset\n\n\n\u2022at a cost of no more than 120% of its market value at the time of the event, or\n\u2022at any cost, provided it (or part of it) was lost or destroyed by a natural disaster and the replacement asset is substantially the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means you disregard any capital gain or capital loss you make when a later CGT event happens to the repaired or replacement asset.\n\n**2. Original asset acquired on or after 20 September 1985**\n\nIf you acquired the original asset on or after 20 September 1985, the way rollover applies will depend on whether the money you received is more or less than the cost of repairing or replacing the asset. If it is more, it also depends on whether the capital gain you make when the event happens is:\n\n\na.more than that excess, or\nb.less than or equal to that excess.\n\n\n\n\n*a. Money received is more than the cost of repair or replacement*\n\nIf you don't use all of the money you received to repair or replace the original asset, this affects your CGT obligations. The amount of capital gain you include in your tax return depends on whether the capital gain is more or less than the difference between the amount you received and the cost of the repair or replacement.\n\nIf the capital gain is more than that difference, you reduce your capital gain to the amount of the excess. Include this amount in your tax return in the year the event happens. This gain may be eligible for the CGT discount. For more information see\n[How to work out your capital gain or capital loss](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATHOWTOWORKOUTYOURCAPITALGAINORCAPITALLOSS%22&PiT=99991231235958#HOWTOWORKOUTYOURCAPITALGAINORCAPITALLOSS)\n.\n\nWhen a later CGT event happens, you reduce the amount of expenditure included in the cost base of the asset by the difference between the capital gain before it is reduced and the excess. This enables you to defer part of your CGT liability until a later CGT event happens.\n\nIf the capital gain is less than or equal to the excess (the compensation amount less the cost of the repair or replacement), you do not reduce the capital gain and the amount of the expenditure on the repair or replacement included in the cost base, see\nexample 93\n.\n\n*b. Money received does not exceed the cost of repair or replacement*\n\nIf the amount of money you received is less than or equal to the expenditure you incurred to repair or replace the original asset, you disregard any capital gain. You reduce the expenditure you include in the cost base of the asset when a later CGT event happens by the amount of the gain, see\n**example 92.**\n\n**Example 92: money received is less than expenditure incurred**\n> Gerard's business premises were destroyed by a bushfire fire on 15 January 2024. He received $246,000 in compensation from his insurance company.\n\n> It cost him $257,000 to reconstruct the premises, $11,000 more than the amount of compensation he received.\n\n> Gerard made a capital gain of $2,000 because his cost base apportioned to the building was $244,000 at the time of the fire.\n\n> 1. Compensation money received is $246,000.\n\n> 2.\n> *Subtract*\n> cost base of $244,000.\n\n> 3. The total capital gain is $2,000.\n\n> 4. Compensation money received is $246,000.\n\n> 5.\n> *Subtract*\n> replacement expenditure of $257,000.\n\n> 6. Shortfall amount is $11,000.\n\n> As the compensation money does not exceed the repair expenditure, Gerard disregards the capital gain.\n\n> However, the amount of expenditure that Gerard can include in the cost base of the repaired building is reduced by the amount of the capital gain ($2,000) to $255,000.\n\n\n\n**Example 93: money received is more than the expenditure incurred**\n> Assume that, in the previous example, Gerard incurred only $240,000 for repairs and the cost attributed to the building was $230,000.\n\n> 1. Compensation money received is $246,000.\n\n> 2.\n> *Subtract*\n> cost base of $230,000.\n\n> 3. The total capital gain is $16,000.\n\n> 4. Compensation money received is $246,000.\n\n> 5.\n> *Subtract*\n> replacement expenditure of $240,000.\n\n> 6. Total excess is $6,000.\n\n> The compensation money ($246,000) is $6,000 more than the replacement expenditure ($240,000). The capital gain ($16,000) is $10,000 more than the excess of $6,000. The capital gain is reduced to the excess amount of $6,000.\n\n> Gerard's capital gain (before applying the CGT discount of 50%) is $6,000. Therefore, assuming he has not made any other capital losses or capital gains in the 2023\u201324 income year (and does not have any unapplied net capital losses from earlier years) Gerard includes $3,000 ($6,000 \u00d7 50%) as his net capital gain for the 2023\u201324 income year.\n\n> Also, he reduces the expenditure he incurred on the replacement asset by the balance of the capital gain ($10,000) to $230,000. This means $10,000 of the capital gain is deferred.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, see\n[Insurance payouts after a disaster](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/financial-difficulties-and-disasters/support-in-difficult-times/natural-disaster-support/recovery-following-natural-disasters/insurance-payouts-after-a-disaster)\n.\n\n**If you receive an asset**\n\nIf you receive a replacement asset when the CGT event happens, you can choose a rollover only if:\n\n\n\u2022the replacement asset is not a depreciating asset, not a registered emissions unit or held as trading stock when you acquire it\n\u2022the market value of the replacement asset is more than the cost base of the original asset just before the event happened.\n\n\n\n\n***Consequences of receiving an asset***\n\nIf you choose to take a rollover when you receive a replacement asset, you disregard any capital gain you make from the original asset. The other consequences are outlined below.\n\n***Original asset acquired before 20 September 1985***\n\nIf you acquired the original asset before 20 September 1985, you are taken to have acquired the new asset before that day.\n\n***Original asset acquired on or after 20 September 1985***\n\nIf you acquired the original asset on or after 20 September 1985, the first element of the cost base and reduced cost base of the replacement asset is taken to be the cost base and reduced cost base of the original asset at the time of the event.\n\nHowever, you may have to recalculate the first element of the cost base of your replacement asset if the cost base of the original asset included an amount of indexation and you are seeking to apply the CGT discount to a capital gain from the replacement asset.\n\n**Example 94: asset received**\n> Jon acquired land after 19 September 1985 which the state government compulsorily acquired on 14 July 2023. The cost base of the land at the time it was compulsorily acquired was $180,000. As compensation, Jon received another piece of land with a market value of $200,000.\n\n> Because the market value of the replacement land was greater than the cost base of the original land just before it was compulsorily acquired, Jon disregards the capital gain made on the disposal of the original land. Jon is taken to have paid $180,000 to acquire the replacement land (that is, the cost base of the original land at the time it was compulsorily acquired).\n\n\n\n\n\n**If you receive both money and an asset**\n\nIf you receive both money and an asset and choose to take a rollover, the requirements and consequences are different for each part of the compensation.\n\nYou need to separately determine what happens to the replacement asset and the money, having regard to the proportion of the original asset attributable to each type of compensation.\n\nThe rules are then applied separately to the money and to the asset.\n\n**Example 95: money and an asset received as compensation**\n> The state government compulsorily acquires land Kris bought in 2003. Its cost base at the time was $150,000 but Kris received compensation worth $160,000.\n\n> Half of the total compensation is money ($80,000) and half is replacement land (market value $80,000).\n\n> Therefore, the cost base of the original land attributable to each part of the compensation is $75,000 (50% \u00d7 $150,000). Kris bought additional replacement land for $82,000.\n\n> The total capital gain is $10,000 which is capital proceeds of cash and property totalling $160,000 less the cost base of $150,000. Half of this capital gain can be attributed to the money and half to the asset (the replacement land).\n\n> The money Kris received as compensation is less than the amount he paid to buy the additional land. He can therefore disregard the $5,000 of the capital gain that is attributable to the money compensation. He reduces the expenditure on the additional land by $5,000, so the first element of its cost base is only $77,000.\n\n> As the market value of the replacement land is more than that part of the cost base of the original land, Kris can choose to take rollover relief and disregard the capital gain of $5,000 relating to the land.\n\n> As a result, the value of the replacement land ($75,000) forms the first element of its cost base, not its market value ($80,000) when he acquired it.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Indexation or CGT discount**\n\nIf a CGT event happens to the replacement asset (for example, a later disposal), you may be able to use the indexation method or the discount method to calculate your capital gain. This applies only if the periods of ownership of the original asset and the replacement asset add up to at least 12 months. For indexation to apply, you must have acquired the asset before 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999.\n\n**Main residence \u2013 compulsory acquisition**\n\nThe main residence exemption can apply to certain compulsory acquisitions (or similar arrangements) which are associated with your main residence but not with your dwelling.\n\nYou can ignore a capital gain or capital loss you make from a compulsory acquisition (or similar arrangement) that happens only to land that is adjacent to:\n\n\n\u2022a dwelling that is your main residence\n\u2022a dwelling that passed to you as a beneficiary or trustee of a deceased estate.\n\n\n\n\nThe main residence exemption will apply to the extent that the land was used primarily for private or domestic purposes in association with the dwelling.\n\nThe maximum area of vacant land covered by the exemption is 2 hectares less the area of land underneath the dwelling.\n\nThis applies to CGT events that happen on or after 29 June 2011.\n\nYou also have the choice to apply the main residence exemption to CGT events that happened during the transitional period:\n\n\n\u2022starting at the beginning of the 2004\u201305 income year\n\u2022ending immediately before 29 June 2011.\n\n\n\n\nThe main residence exemption applies to structures adjacent to a flat or home unit, such as a garage or a storeroom, in the same way as it applies to land adjacent to a dwelling.\n\nA partial CGT exemption may apply where the dwelling was:\n\n\n\u2022not used as a main residence during all of the relevant ownership period\n\u2022used for income-producing purposes.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, see:\n\n\n\u2022[Partial exemption](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATPARTIALEXEMPTIONFORMAINRESIDENCE%22&PiT=99991231235958#PARTIALEXEMPTIONFORMAINRESIDENCE)\n\u2022[Dwelling used to produce income.](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATDWELLINGUSEDTOPRODUCEINCOME%22&PiT=99991231235958#DWELLINGUSEDTOPRODUCEINCOME)\n\n\n\n\nThe exemption for compulsory acquisitions of part of your main residence can apply to all the relevant CGT events, which is broader than the CGT events that the ordinary main residence exemption can apply to.\n\nIf you are a foreign resident when a CGT event happens to your residential property in Australia under a compulsory acquisition arrangement you may no longer be entitled to claim the main residence exemption.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Main residence exemption for foreign residents](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/capital-gains-tax/foreign-residents-and-capital-gains-tax/main-residence-exemption-for-foreign-residents)\n.\n\n***What is compulsory acquisition?***\n\nAll levels of Australian Government or entities acting on behalf of government can compulsorily acquire land and associated structures or an interest in land for a public purpose.\n\nCompulsory acquisition involves your ownership interest in the land being compulsorily acquired by:\n\n\n\u2022an Australian Government agency (that is, by the Australian, a state or a territory government or by an authority of the Australian, a state or a territory government)\n\u2022a non-government entity authorised to do so under a power conferred by an Australian law.\n\n\n\n\nThe acquirer serves a notice on the landowner inviting them to negotiate for the disposal of the asset or part of the asset. This notice should inform the landowner that if negotiations are unsuccessful, the acquirer will proceed to acquire the asset or part of the asset in accordance with its legislative powers. Even if the landowner accepts the initial or negotiated offer, this is viewed to be a compulsory acquisition. This type of negotiated disposal is referred to as an acquisition under the shadow of compulsion.\n\nThis would typically involve:\n\n\n\u2022compulsorily acquiring part of the land adjacent to your residence\n\u2022compulsorily acquiring a structure such as a garage, storeroom or other structure associated with your flat or home unit.\n\n\n\n\nArrangements similar to a compulsory acquisition include the following:\n\n\n\u2022Your ownership interest in the land is compulsorily cancelled (however described), including compulsorily terminated or revoked.\n\u2022Your ownership interest in the land is varied (however described), for example, removing your ownership right to further develop the main residence. It could restrict your ability to erect structures above a certain level, for example installing antennas or remove your right to dig below the soil inhibiting your ability to undertake any further structural development of the property.\n\u2022Your ownership interest in the land is surrendered (however described) or varied (however described) under the shadow of compulsion.\n\u2022An interest or right in, or relating to, your land is compulsorily conferred on an Australian Government agency or an entity under a power conferred by an Australian law, for example, compulsorily creating a right of access over part of land adjacent to your dwelling.\n\u2022You confer on an entity an interest in, or right in, or relating to, your land under the shadow of compulsion, for example, compulsorily negotiating an agreement in relation to a temporary right in relation to your main residence. Government could require temporary access through your property to improve property that is used for a public purpose.\n\u2022Your ownership interest in the land was conferred on you by an Australian Government agency for a limited, but renewable period of operation, and that ownership interest was not renewed by that agency. For example, a right that you hold over the land is not renewed, such as a Crown lease.\n\n\n\n\nThe exemption doesn't apply to compulsory acquisitions, or similar arrangements, of adjacent land or a structure where the dwelling to which they relate is outside Australia.\n\n**Example 96: full main residence exemption**\n> Debbie and Geoff live in a 3 bedroom house on a small suburban block that is 2 hectares. In July 2009, the Department of Main Roads commenced negotiations with several home owners in Debbie and Geoff's neighbourhood to end ownership rights over part of the land adjacent to the dwelling. When their ownership rights end, Debbie and Geoff along with other home owners would not be able to build on that part of the land or conduct any activities on that part of the land.\n\n> The area adjacent to their dwelling on which their ownership right ends is 50 square metres (10 metres wide by 5 metres located along the rear boundary)\n\n> They qualify for full main residence exemption because they have lived in the dwelling throughout their ownership period. This means Debbie and Geoff would be able to apply the main residence exemption to the proceeds they received for the compulsory acquisition which ended their ownership rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n***How much will be part of your main residence***\n\nIf your property exceeds 2 hectares you will need to determine how much and which parts of your property will form part of your main residence exemption area.\n\nIf the land used for private purposes is greater than 2 hectares, you can choose which 2 hectares are exempt.\n\n**Example 97: land exceeds 2 hectares**\n> Robyn's property is 10.35 hectares. She identifies the dwellings, land and associated structures that are linked to the main residence and are for private or personal use as a total of 1.90 hectares. The driveway is 1500 square metres in area. Adding the driveway for personal use makes the adjacent land covered by the exemption greater than 2 hectares (2.05 hectares). Robyn decides to exclude 500 square metres of driveway to ensure that the total area of the land is not greater than 2 hectares.\n\n\n\n*Land exceeds 2 hectares*\n  \n\n| Calculation element | Hectares | Square metres |\n| **Main residence** | 0.0345 | 345 |\n| **Swimming pool** | 0.0044 | 44 |\n| **Dam 1 (pump water to landscaped gardens)** | 0.3500 | 3,500 |\n| **Garage** | 0.0100 | 100 |\n| **Guest house** | 0.0153 | 153 |\n| **Driveway** | 0.1000 | 1,000 |\n| **Landscaped gardens** | 1.4857 | 14,857 |\n| **Total** | 2.00 | 20,000 |\n\n\n\n***Maximum exempt area***\n\nWhere you have previously disregarded one or more capital gains or losses for a compulsory acquisition (or similar arrangement) of adjacent land or structure, the maximum area of adjacent land available for the main residence exemption when the dwelling is eventually sold (or otherwise realised) is reduced. The reduced area is called the 'maximum exempt area'.\n\nHowever, the maximum exempt area is only reduced by a previous compulsory acquisition or similar arrangement where you lost rights to the substantial use and enjoyment of that land either completely or for at least 10 years.\n\nThis rule ensures you are not disadvantaged by having to reduce your maximum exempt area where you have lost only insubstantial rights to the use and enjoyment of the exempt land. It also ensures that you are not disadvantaged where you lose substantial rights to the use and enjoyment of the exempt land but only for a short term such as under a short-term lease. This means that such land will remain eligible for a later application of the main residence exemption.\n\nExamples of compulsory arrangements that don't result in substantial loss of rights to the use and enjoyment of the land might include where an easement is granted over vacant land which still permits the use and enjoyment of the land. Another example might be where the government compulsorily acquires subsurface land under your main residence. If you did not use or enjoy the subsurface land and the compulsory acquisition didn't result in you losing rights to the substantial use and enjoyment of the surface land, then the maximum exempt area would not be reduced.\n\n**Example 98: reduction in maximum exempt area**\n> In January 2006, the government contacted Robyn and advised that they are acquiring 1.40 hectares of her land for the development of a freeway. Part of this acquisition includes the dam and landscaped gardens Robyn had identified as being part of the main residence. The area of the acquisition includes 0.40 of a hectare of Robyn's main residence.\n\n> Robyn may choose to apply the main residence capital gains tax exemption to the part of the capital proceeds, received for the compulsory acquisition, which relates to the 0.40 hectares of the land Robyn had recorded as being associated with the main residence.\n\n> After the compulsory acquisition Robyn's property is reduced to 8.95 hectares. The dam and part of her landscaped gardens were acquired by the government for the freeway. Robyn is not able to revise the land and structures that are associated with her main residence. Her maximum exempt area is reduced by the 0.4 hectares she had previously attributed to her main residence that was acquired by the government.\n\n\n\n*Reduction in maximum exempt area*\n  \n\n| **Calculation element** | **Hectares** | **Square metres** |\n| **Main Residence** | 0.0345 | 345 |\n| **Swimming pool** | 0.0044 | 44 |\n| **Garage** | 0.0100 | 100 |\n| **Guest house** | 0.0153 | 153 |\n| **Driveway** | 0.1000 | 1,000 |\n| **Landscaped gardens** | 1.4357 | 14,357 |\n| **Total** | 1.6 | 16,000 |\n\n\n\n***Exemption conditions to be met***\n\nWhere you satisfy all of the following conditions any capital gain or capital loss arising from the compulsory acquisition (or similar arrangement) of adjacent land or structure without the dwelling is automatically disregarded.\n\nThe conditions that must be met are:\n\n\n\u2022you are an individual\n\u2022the exempt land is all or part of a dwelling's adjacent land at the time of the CGT event\n\u2022the CGT event does not happen in relation to the dwelling or your ownership interest in the dwelling\n\u2022one of the following applies\n\n\n-the dwelling was your main residence during some or all of the period you owned it\n-your ownership interest in the dwelling passed to you as a beneficiary in a deceased estate, or\n-you own the ownership interest in the dwelling as the trustee of a deceased estate\n\n\n\n\u2022the adjacent land or structure is compulsorily acquired or is the subject of a similar compulsory arrangement\n\u2022the sum of the following is 2 hectares or less\n\n\n-the area of all of the dwelling's adjacent land at the time of the CGT event\n-the area of land on which the dwelling is built\n-for each earlier CGT event that resulted in a capital gain or capital loss being disregarded under this exemption, the area of adjacent land exempted at the time of the earlier CGT event, but only if that involved reducing the area of the dwelling's adjacent land at the time of that earlier CGT event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis last condition ensures that you will not be disadvantaged by double counting of the same area of land where you have not lost substantial use and enjoyment of the land, for example, a compulsory easement is created over land but you retain ownership of the land affected by the easement, although with diminished rights.\n\nWhere you satisfy all of the conditions apart from the last condition (that is, where the sum of the relevant areas of land is more than 2 hectares), there is no automatic disregarding of any capital gain or capital loss arising from the compulsory acquisition (or similar arrangement).\n\nIn these circumstances, you can choose to disregard so much of the capital gain or capital loss that relates to an area of adjacent land that is compulsorily acquired (or subject to a similar arrangement) that is not more than the maximum exempt area.\n\n***Record keeping requirements***\n\nWith all assets you need to keep records. In this case, you will need to keep records of the transactions or events that provide evidence of your assessment of how the main residence capital gains tax exemption applies to the part of your main residence that has been compulsorily acquired. This includes a record of your calculations of your capital gain or loss and if your property is greater than 2 hectares.\n\nTo find out more about the record keeping requirements in relation to assets and capital gain tax see\n[Keeping CGT records](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATKEEPINGRCGTECORDS%22&PiT=99991231235958#KEEPINGRCGTECORDS)\n.\n\n### Marriage or relationship breakdown\n\nExplains if your marriage or relationship ended on or after 20 September 1985 and you transfer an asset or a share of an asset to your spouse, you receive an asset or a share of an asset from your spouse, or a company or trustee of a trust transfers an asset to you or your spouse.\n\n**On this page**\n\n\n\u2022[Overview](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATOVERVIEW2%22&PiT=99991231235958#OVERVIEW2)\n\u2022[Conditions for the marriage or relationship breakdown rollover](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCONDITIONSFORTHEMARRIAGEORRELATIONSHIPBREAKDOWNROLLOVER%22&PiT=99991231235958#CONDITIONSFORTHEMARRIAGEORRELATIONSHIPBREAKDOWNROLLOVER)\n\u2022[Consequences of the rollover](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCONSEQUENCESOFTHEROLLOVER%22&PiT=99991231235958#CONSEQUENCESOFTHEROLLOVER)\n\u2022[CGT assets transferred by a company or trust](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCGTASSETSTRANSFERREDBYACOMPANYORTRUST%22&PiT=99991231235958#CGTASSETSTRANSFERREDBYACOMPANYORTRUST)\n\u2022[Superannuation interests](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATSUPERANNUATIONINTERESTS%22&PiT=99991231235958#SUPERANNUATIONINTERESTS)\n\u2022[Cash settlements](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCASHSETTLEMENTS%22&PiT=99991231235958#CASHSETTLEMENTS)\n\u2022[Real estate that was a main residence](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATREALESTATETHATWASAMAINRESIDENCE%22&PiT=99991231235958#REALESTATETHATWASAMAINRESIDENCE)\n\u2022[Consequences of the rollover not applying](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCONSEQUENCESOFTHEROLLOVERNOTAPPLYING%22&PiT=99991231235958#CONSEQUENCESOFTHEROLLOVERNOTAPPLYING)\n\n\n\n\n**Overview**\n\nWhen we talk about 'your\n[spouse](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATA4(SPOUSE)%22&PiT=99991231235958#A4(SPOUSE))\n', this includes your former spouse. It does not include your spouse's or your former spouse's legal personal representative (such as an executor).\n\n**Transfer**\nof an asset means transferring ownership of an asset to the transferee spouse and includes\n**creating**\nan asset in their favour (such as a right to use property).\n\nWhere we talk about\n**an asset,**\nthis includes a share of, or an interest in, a jointly owned asset.\n\n**Transferee spouse**\nrefers to the spouse to whom an asset is transferred, while the\n**transferor**\nis the person (or a company or the trustee of a trust) who transfers an asset to the transferee spouse.\n\nAs a general rule, CGT applies to all changes of ownership of assets on or after 20 September 1985. However, if you transfer an asset to your spouse as a result of the breakdown of your marriage or relationship, there is an automatic rollover in certain cases. You can't choose whether or not it applies.\n\nThis rollover ensures the transferor spouse disregards a capital gain or capital loss that would otherwise arise. In effect, the one who receives the asset (the transferee spouse) will make the capital gain or capital loss when they subsequently dispose of the asset. If you are the transferee spouse, the cost base of the asset is transferred to you.\n\n**Conditions for the marriage or relationship breakdown rollover**\n\nFor the rollover to apply, the CGT event must have happened because of:\n\n\n\u2022an order of a court or court order made by consent under the\n*Family Law Act 1975*\nor a similar law of a foreign country\n\u2022a court order under a state, territory or foreign law relating to breakdown of relationship between spouses.\n\n\n\n\nThe rollover also applies to CGT events that happen after 12 December 2006 because of one of the following:\n\n\n\u2022a financial agreement that is binding under section 90G of the\n*Family Law Act 1975*\n(known as a 'binding financial agreement') or a corresponding written agreement that is binding because of a corresponding foreign law\n\u2022an award made in an arbitration referred to in section 13H of the\n*Family Law Act 1975*\n(known as an 'arbitral award') or a similar award under a corresponding state, territory or foreign law\n\u2022a written agreement that is binding because of a state, territory or foreign law relating to breakdowns of relationship between spouses and because of such law, a court is prevented from making an order\n\n\n-about matters to which the agreement applies, or\n-that is inconsistent with the terms of the agreement for those matters, unless the agreement is varied or set aside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are referred to below as 'binding agreements' used by separating couples. The following agreements relating to relationship breakdowns meet these requirements:\n\n\n\u2022a domestic relationship agreement or termination agreement that complies with subsection 47(1) of the\n*New South Wales Property (Relationships) Act 1984*\n\u2022a recognised agreement within the meaning of the\n*Queensland Property Law Act 1974*\n\u2022a cohabitation agreement that is a certificated agreement within the meaning of the\n*South Australian's Domestic Partner Property Act 1996*\n\u2022a personal relationship agreement or separation agreement that complies with subsection 62(1) of the\n*Tasmanian Relationships Act 2003*\n\u2022a financial agreement that complies with subsection 205ZS(1) of the\n*Western Australian Family Court Act 1997*\n\u2022a domestic relationship agreement or termination agreement that complies with subsection 33(1) of the\n*Australian Capital Territory's Domestic Relationships Act 1994*\n\u2022a cohabitation agreement or separation agreement that complies with subsection 45(2) of the\n*Northern Territory's De Facto Relationships Act*\n\u2022a relationship agreement that complies with subsections 59(1) and (2) of the\n*Victorian Relationships Act 2008*\n(which came into effect on 1 December 2008).\n\n\n\n\nFrom 1 March 2009 the rollover also applies to CGT events that happen because of a financial agreement that is binding because of section 90UJ of the\n*Family Law Act 1975*\n(known as a 'binding financial agreement') or a corresponding written agreement that is binding because of a corresponding foreign law. Section 90UJ relates to agreements made between parties to a de facto relationship.\n\nIn addition, from 2009\u201310 the marriage breakdown rollover was extended to same-sex couples.\n\n***Timing of the CGT event***\n\nBecause certain changes to the marriage or relationship breakdown rollover rules apply to CGT events that happened after 12 December 2006 it is important to know when those events happened.\n[Appendix 1](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATA1%22&PiT=99991231235958#A1)\ncontains information about the timing of CGT events.\n\nIf an asset was transferred under a contract, the CGT event happened when the contract was entered into.\n\nA binding financial agreement may be a contract. The time at which a contract is entered into depends on the terms and conditions of the agreement and the relevant legislation being satisfied such that the agreement can take effect. In the case of a binding financial agreement, a separation declaration has to be made under section 90DA of the\n*Family Law Act 1975*\nbefore the agreement can take effect.\n\nA binding agreement used by a marriage or relationship breakdown couple may be a contract. The time at which a contract was entered into depends on the terms and conditions of the agreement and the relevant legislation being satisfied such that the agreement could take effect.\n\nIf there is no contract, the CGT event happened when the change of ownership of the asset occurred.\n\nTransfers made because of a court order or arbitral award are not made under a contract. Therefore, no CGT event happened until the asset was transferred under the order or award.\n\nIf the asset was transferred under an agreement to which CGT event B1 (see\n[Appendix 1](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATA1%22&PiT=99991231235958#A1)\n) applied, the event happened when use of the asset passed to the transferee spouse.\n\nBinding financial agreements can be entered into before, during or after marriage or relationship. Arbitral awards allow property and financial matters of separating couples to be settled using arbitration. These arrangements allow separating couples to settle their affairs without having to go through court processes, which are often costly and protracted.\n\n***Rollovers that don't require court intervention***\n\nFor transfers that happen because of a binding financial agreement, or a binding agreement used by a separating couple, the rollover only applies if at the time of the transfer:\n\n\n\u2022the spouses involved were separated\n\u2022there is no reasonable likelihood of cohabitation being resumed, and\n\u2022the transfer happened because of reasons directly connected with the breakdown of the marriage or relationship.\n\n\n\n\nThe transfer may not be directly connected with the breakdown if, for example:\n\n\n\u2022the spouses had an agreement before the breakdown of their marriage or relationship stating that the particular property was to be transferred between them for other reasons not directly related to the marriage or relationship breakdown\n\u2022the agreement provided for the transfer of non-specific property, the transfer does not occur for a considerable time (say, more than 12 months) after the agreement, and factors are present that suggest the transfer was not directly connected to the marriage or relationship breakdown.\n\n\n\n\n***Relevant CGT events***\n\nFor the rollover to apply, one of the following events must have happened. The transferor:\n\n\n\u2022disposed of an asset to the transferee spouse (CGT event A1)\n\u2022entered into an agreement with the transferee spouse under which\n\n\n-the right to use and enjoy a CGT asset passed to the transferee spouse\n-title in the asset will or may pass to the transferee spouse at the end of the agreement (CGT event B1). There is no rollover if title in the CGT asset does not pass to the transferee spouse when the agreement ends\n\n\n\n\u2022created a contractual or other right in favour of the transferee spouse (CGT event D1)\n\u2022granted an option to the transferee spouse or renewed or extended an option granted to them (CGT event D2)\n\u2022owned a prospecting or mining entitlement, or an interest in one, and granted the transferee spouse a right to receive income from operations carried on by the entitlement (CGT event D3), or\n\u2022was a lessor and granted, renewed or extended a lease to the transferee spouse (CGT event F1).\n\n\n\n\nThere is no rollover for the transfer of trading stock.\n\n**Consequences of the rollover**\n\nIn this section:\n\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n***You transfer the asset***\n\nIf you transferred the asset, the consequences of the rollover are:\n\n\n\u2022you disregard any capital gain or capital loss for assets acquired before 20 September 1985\n\u2022for assets acquired on or after 20 September 1985, the marriage or relationship breakdown rollover ensures you disregard any capital gain or capital loss you make from the CGT event that involves you and the transferee spouse.\n\n\n\n\n***The asset is transferred to you***\n\nYou will need to determine the date the asset was acquired before being transferred to you.\n\n*Assets acquired before 20 September 1985*\n\nIf a CGT asset, including a share of a jointly owned asset, was transferred to you because of the breakdown of your marriage or relationship and it was acquired by the transferor before 20 September 1985, you are also taken to have acquired the asset before that date. You disregard any capital gain or capital loss you make when you later dispose of the asset.\n\nHowever, if you made a major capital improvement to that asset after 20 September 1985, you may be subject to CGT when you dispose of it or another CGT event happens to that asset.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Other capital improvements to pre-CGT assets](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATOTHERCAPITALIMPROVEMENTSTOPRECGTASSETS%22&PiT=99991231235958#OTHERCAPITALIMPROVEMENTSTOPRECGTASSETS)\n.\n\n*Assets acquired on or after 20 September 1985*\n\nThe rules are different if the asset was acquired by the transferor on or after 20 September 1985. In this case, if you received the CGT asset (or a share of a jointly owned asset) and there was a marriage or relationship breakdown rollover, you are taken to have acquired the asset (or share of the asset) at the time it was transferred from your spouse (or the company or trustee).\n\nTo calculate your capital gain or capital loss when a later CGT event happened, the first element of your cost base and reduced cost base are the same as the cost base and reduced cost base of your spouse (or the company or trustee) at the time of the transfer. Your cost base and reduced cost base also include any costs incurred by you or the previous owner (your spouse, the company or trustee) in transferring the particular asset on the breakdown of your marriage or relationship, such as conveyancing costs and stamp duty. General legal costs relating to the breakdown or incurred in seeking a property settlement, and payments made under a Family Court order representing the increase in value of the CGT asset, are not included.\n\nIf the transferor's cost base includes an amount of indexation, you may later have to recalculate the first element of your cost base to exclude that amount if you want to apply the CGT discount to your capital gain.\n\nIf you acquired the asset from your spouse (or the company or trustee) before 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999, you may be able to use the indexation method when calculating your capital gain. This can only apply if your and your spouse's combined period of ownership is 12 months or more (or your and the company's or trustee's combined period of ownership is 12 months or more).\n\nIf you acquired the asset after 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999, you can't use the indexation method when calculating your capital gain but you may be able to use the discount method. You can use the discount method to calculate your capital gain if your and your spouse's combined period of ownership is 12 months or more. If the period is less than 12 months, you use the 'other' method.\n\nCollectables or personal use assets remain collectables or personal use assets when they are transferred from your spouse (or the company or trustee) in the case of a marriage or relationship breakdown rollover.\n\nFor information about collectables and personal use assets, see\n[What is a CGT asset?](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATWHATISACGTASSET%22&PiT=99991231235958#WHATISACGTASSET)\n\nThere are several instances where your spouse (or a company or trustee) may create an asset in your favour.\n**Table 5**\nexplains how to calculate the first element of your cost base and reduced cost base of that asset in each case.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n*Table 5: Calculation of cost base*\n  \n\n| CGT event | First element of cost base and reduced cost base |\n| Creating contractual or other rights (D1) | Incidental costs incurred by the transferor that relate to the event |\n| Granting an option (D2) | Expenditure incurred by the transferor to grant the option |\n| Granting a right to income from mining (D3) | Expenditure incurred by the transferor to grant the right |\n| Granting a lease (F1) | Expenditure incurred by the transferor on the grant renewal or extension of the lease |\n\n\n\nYou are taken to have acquired the asset at the time specified by the CGT event. For example, for CGT event D1, you acquired the asset at the time you entered into the contract, or, if there is no contract, at the time the right was created. For more information, see\n[Appendix 1](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATA1%22&PiT=99991231235958#A1)\n.\n\n**CGT assets transferred by a company or trust**\n\nIf a company or a trustee of a trust transferred a CGT asset to a spouse, adjustments are required to the relevant cost base and reduced cost base of interests in the company or trust. These may have been shares (or indirect interests in shares) in the company, units in a unit trust and other interests in the trust. They are reduced in value by an amount that reasonably reflects the fall in their market value as a result of the transfer of the CGT asset.\n\nIf the transferor was a controlled foreign corporation or a foreign trust, there are special rules for working out the capital gain or capital loss for a subsequent CGT event.\n\nGenerally, the transfer of an asset from a private company to a spouse who is a shareholder or an associate of a shareholder is treated as a payment for the purposes of Division 7A of the\n*Income Tax Assessment Act 1936,*\nwhich the company may be taken to have paid a dividend because of that payment.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Payments by private companies](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/corporate-tax-measures-and-assurance/private-company-benefits-division-7a-dividends/in-detail/division-7a-payments)\n.\n\n**Example 99: transfer of assets from a marriage or relationship**\n> Danny and Claudia jointly owned the following assets immediately before their marriage breakdown:\n> \n> \n> *Danny and Claudia's joint assets*\n>   \n> \n> | Asset | When purchased | Cost  $ |\n> | **The family home** | January 1985 | 75,000 |\n> | **Holiday house** | December 1988 | 65,000 |\n> | **Shares in a company** | March 1999 | 35,000 |\n\n> After their permanent separation in October 2023, the Family Court approved the couple's agreement and made an appropriate court order by consent.\n\n> Danny transferred his interest in the family home to Claudia in March 2024 under the court order. Because it was acquired by the couple before 20 September 1985 and the CGT rollover applied, she is taken to have acquired Danny's interest in the home before that date. Therefore, Claudia will not have to pay tax on any capital gains when she sells the home, that is, either on her original interest in the home, or the interest Danny transferred to her.\n\n> Danny has no CGT obligation on the transfer to Claudia of his interest in the family home.\n\n> Claudia's interests in the shares and the holiday house were transferred to Danny in March 2023 under the court order. The holiday house did not become his home.\n\n> Although the couple acquired these assets on or after 20 September 1985, Claudia's capital gains from the transfer of her interests in these assets to Danny are disregarded under the marriage breakdown rollover.\n\n> Danny is taken to have acquired Claudia's interests in these assets at the time of transfer for her relevant cost bases. If he were to sell the holiday home or the shares, he would separately calculate his capital gain or capital loss in respect of his original interest and the interest he acquired from Claudia.\n\n> When he sells the assets, Danny can choose to apply the indexation method or the discount method to work out the amount of any capital gain from his original interests because they were acquired before 21 September 1999.\n\n> Because he acquired Claudia's interests after that date, he can only choose the discount method to work out any capital gain on them. However, in applying the 12-month ownership test for the purposes of the CGT discount, he can take into account the period that Claudia owned the interest.\n\n> Danny will have to ensure that the cost bases of the interests he acquired from Claudia don't include any amount of indexation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf these rules apply to you, seek help from us or a recognised tax adviser.\n\n**Superannuation interests**\n\n***Payment splits***\n\nA CGT rollover may apply if an interest in a small superannuation fund is subject to:\n\n\n\u2022a payment split on the breakdown of relationship between spouses\n\u2022a CGT asset of a small superannuation fund is transferred to another complying superannuation fund.\n\n\n\n\nA small superannuation fund is one that is a complying fund with no more than 6 members.\n\n***Transfer of own interest in a small superannuation fund***\n\nA trustee of a small superannuation fund also qualifies for CGT rollover when the trustee transfers an asset or assets reflecting the entire personal interest of one of the spouses or former spouses to the trustee of another complying superannuation fund for the benefit of that spouse. For the rollover to apply both spouses must hold an interest in the small superannuation fund before the transfer. This allows spouses to separate their superannuation arrangements on the breakdown of their relationship without any CGT liability.\n\nTo qualify for a rollover, the spouses have to be permanently separated at the time of the transfer, the transfer has to have happened because of reasons directly connected with the breakdown of the relationship between spouses and, the transfer has to have been made in accordance with:\n\n\n\u2022a court order made under section 79 or subsection 90AE(2) or 90AF(2), section 90SM or 90YX of the\n*Family Law Act 1975*\nor a corresponding foreign law\n\u2022a court order made under a state, territory or foreign law relating to breakdowns of relationship between spouses that corresponds to an order made under the\n*Family Law Act 1975*\n\u2022an award made in an arbitration referred to in section 13H of the\n*Family Law Act 1975*\n(known as an arbitral award) or a corresponding award made in an arbitration under a corresponding state, territory or foreign law\n\u2022a financial agreement that is binding under section 90UJ of the\n*Family Law Act 1975*\n(known as a 'binding financial agreement') and was made on or after 1 March 2009\n\u2022a financial agreement that is binding under section 90G of the\n*Family Law Act 1975*\n(known as a 'binding financial agreement') or a corresponding written agreement that is binding because of a corresponding foreign law\n\u2022a written agreement that is binding because of a state, territory or foreign law relating to breakdowns of relationship between spouses and, that because of such a law, a court is prevented from making an order about matters to which the agreement applies, or that is inconsistent with the terms of the agreement for those matters, unless the agreement is varied or set aside.\n\n\n\n\nOnce the trustee has obtained a CGT rollover for such a transfer, the rollover is no longer available for a transfer of any asset reflecting the personal superannuation interest of the other spouse if that later transfer arises out of the same marriage or relationship breakdown.\n\n**Example 100: transfer of superannuation interest**\n> Danny and Claudia each have a personal interest in a small superannuation fund. They reach a binding financial agreement on marriage breakdown, which provides that the trustee transfer all of the assets reflecting Danny's personal interest to another complying superannuation fund. The assets reflecting Danny's personal interest consist of a parcel of shares and a rental property.\n\n> A CGT rollover will apply to the transfer. Consequently, no rollover will then be available to the trustee for any transfer for the benefit of Claudia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe consequences of the rollover for the transfer of a superannuation interest are the same as for the transfer of other assets between spouses as a result of a marriage or relationship breakdown.\n\n**Cash settlements**\n\nChanges to the law ensure that no CGT liability arises in relation to the ending of spouses' rights that directly relate to the breakdown of their marriage or relationship, including if they receive cash as part of a breakdown settlement. No CGT liability arises if, at the time the rights end, the spouses were separated and there was no reasonable likelihood of cohabitation being resumed.\n\n**Real estate that was a main residence**\n\nYou will need to determine the date the CGT event happened.\n\n***Transfers where the CGT event happened on or before 12 December 2006***\n\nIf a dwelling (or an interest in a dwelling) acquired by your spouse on or after 20 September 1985 was transferred to you under a CGT event that happened on or before 12 December 2006, and marriage or relationship breakdown rollover applies, you are entitled to an exemption from CGT (when you dispose of it) for the period it was your main residence after it was transferred to you.\n\nIf the dwelling was your main residence, you may only qualify for a partial exemption if:\n\n\n\u2022it was your main residence for only part of the period after it was transferred to you\n\u2022you used the dwelling to produce assessable income, or\n\u2022the land on which the dwelling is situated is more than 2 hectares.\n\n\n\n\nKeep all relevant records. Make sure you get any records you need from your spouse if you don't already have a copy, including records that show:\n\n\n\u2022how and when they acquired the dwelling (or the interest in a dwelling)\n\u2022its cost base when they transferred it to you.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, see\n[Real estate and main residence](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATREALESTATEANDMAINRESIDENCE%22&PiT=99991231235958#REALESTATEANDMAINRESIDENCE)\n.\n\n***Transfers where the CGT event happened after 12 December 2006***\n\nIf a dwelling (or an interest in a dwelling) acquired by your spouse on or after 20 September 1985 was transferred to you under a CGT event that happened after 12 December 2006, and the marriage or relationship breakdown rollover applies, you take into account the way in which both of you used the dwelling during your combined period of ownership when determining your eligibility for the main residence exemption.\n\nThis means you are entitled to a full exemption from CGT (when you dispose of it) if the land on which the dwelling is situated is 2 hectares or less, and:\n\n\n\u2022during the period your spouse owned the dwelling, it was their main residence and was not being used by them to produce assessable income, and\n\u2022during the period you owned the dwelling, it was your main residence and was not being used by you to produce assessable income.\n\n\n\n\nIf any of these conditions are not met, you may qualify for a partial exemption.\n\nIf the dwelling was not your or your spouse's main residence during all of your combined period of ownership, you work out the proportion of your capital gain that is taxable using the formula:\n\n`A \u00d7 (B + C) \u00f7 D`\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\u2022A is total capital gain or capital loss\n\u2022B is number of days it was not your spouse's main residence during their ownership period\n\u2022C is number of days it was not your main residence during your ownership period\n\u2022D is number of days in your combined period of ownership.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, see\n[Real estate and main residence](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATREALESTATEANDMAINRESIDENCE%22&PiT=99991231235958#REALESTATEANDMAINRESIDENCE)\n.\n\nKeep all relevant records. Make sure you get any records you need from your spouse if you don't already have a copy, including records that show:\n\n\n\u2022how and when they acquired the dwelling (or the interest in a dwelling)\n\u2022its cost base when they transferred it to you\n\u2022the extent (if any) to which it was used to produce income during their ownership period (for example, the periods when it was rented out or available for rent) and the proportion of the dwelling that was used for that purpose\n\u2022the number of days (if any) it was their main residence during their ownership period.\n\n\n**Example 101: dwelling transferred to you under a CGT event that happened after 12 December 2006 becomes your home**\n> George and Natalie jointly purchased a holiday home on 0.1 hectare of land. Settlement of the purchase contract happened on 13 March 2019. On 13 March 2021, George transferred his half-interest to Natalie under the terms of an arbitral award.\n\n> Natalie uses the dwelling as her main residence for 3 years after the date of the CGT event until she sells it. Settlement of the sale contract happens on 13 March 2024.\n\n> Because the dwelling was Natalie's main residence for 3 years out of the 5 years she owned her original interest, she is entitled to a 60% main residence exemption on that interest.\n\n> Because George's half interest in the dwelling was transferred to Natalie under a CGT event that happened after 12 December 2006 and CGT marriage or relationship breakdown rollover applied, Natalie is also entitled to a 60% main residence exemption on that half interest (having regard to how they both used that interest during their combined period of ownership).\n\n> In working out the cost base of the interest George transferred to her, Natalie adds any relevant costs she incurred after George transferred it to her to the cost base of his interest at the time of the transfer.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Home first used to produce income rule applies to combined period of ownership*\n\nIf a dwelling acquired on or after 20 September 1985 is used as a main residence from the time it is acquired and is later used to produce income, the 'home first used to produce income' rule may apply. For the rule to apply, the first income-producing use must be after 20 August 1996 and the dwelling must qualify for full main residence exemption immediately prior to it being used to produce income. See\n[Home first used to produce income](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATHOMEFIRSTUSEDTOPRODUCEINCOME%22&PiT=99991231235958#HOMEFIRSTUSEDTOPRODUCEINCOME)\n.\n\nIf the dwelling (or an interest in the dwelling) is transferred to you under a CGT event that happened after 12 December 2006 and the marriage or relationship breakdown rollover applies to the transfer, the CGT main residence exemption rules take into account the way you and your spouse use the dwelling during your combined period of ownership.\n\nWhere the 'home first used to produce income' rule and the marriage or relationship breakdown rollover apply and the dwelling (or an interest in the dwelling) was transferred to you by your spouse, you are taken to have acquired it at the time it is first used to produce income for its market value at that time. The first income-producing use may be during your or your spouse's ownership period.\n\n**Example 102: home transferred under a CGT event that happens after 12 December 2006 and the 'first used to produce income' rule applies**\n> Harry bought a house on 0.2 hectare of land for $200,000 on 17 November 2000. It was his main residence and was not used by him to produce income.\n\n> On 1 June 2018, he and Anita started living together as spouses. Harry moved into Anita's townhouse and rented out the house. The house was valued at $250,000 at the time.\n\n> Harry and Anita had one child before their relationship broke down in 2022. Harry gave notice to the tenants that the lease on the house wouldn't be renewed.\n\n> On 1 June 2023, Anita moved into the house with their child. Under a binding agreement entered into on the same day, Harry transferred the house to Anita. A CGT rollover applied. (Anita also transferred her townhouse to Harry under the agreement.)\n\n> Anita is taken to have acquired the house on 1 June 2018 for the market value at that time ($250,000) because it was first used to produce income at that time. The following facts are relevant in determining eligibility for the main residence exemption in this example:\n> \n> \n> \u2022Harry acquired the house after 19 September 1985\n> \u2022it was his main residence from the time he became the owner\n> \u2022the house was first rented out after 20 August 1996\n> \u2022the CGT event under which the house was transferred to Anita happened after 12 December 2006 and a CGT rollover applied\n> \u2022Anita would be entitled to a partial main residence exemption on the sale of the house\n> \u2022Harry would have obtained a full main residence exemption had he sold it just before he began renting it out on 1 June 2018.\n\n> If Anita sells the house under a contract that is settled on 1 June 2028 and it is her main residence until that time, she would obtain a 50% exemption, because it would have been her main residence for 5 years (1 June 2023 to 1 June 2028) out of the 10 years after she is taken to have acquired it.\n\n\n\n\n\n***Choices made under the CGT main residence rules***\n\nIn certain circumstances, you may choose to treat a dwelling as your main residence for a period, even though you no longer live in it, see\n[Continuing main residence status after dwelling ceases to be your main residence](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATSTATUSAFTERDWELLINGCEASESTOBEYOURMAINRESIDENCE%22&PiT=99991231235958#STATUSAFTERDWELLINGCEASESTOBEYOURMAINRESIDENCE)\nor you are yet to live in it, see\n[Constructing, renovating or repairing a dwelling on land you already own](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCONSTRUCTINGRENOVATINGORREPAIRINGADWELLINGONLANDYOUALREADYOWN%22&PiT=99991231235958#CONSTRUCTINGRENOVATINGORREPAIRINGADWELLINGONLANDYOUALREADYOWN)\n.\n\nSuch choices are not required to be made by a transferor spouse where a rollover applies because the capital gain or capital loss is disregarded. However, there is nothing to prevent the transferor spouse making a choice (for example, as part of the negotiations with the transferee spouse and transferee spouse's advisers about the transfer of a dwelling or an interest in a dwelling).\n\nIf there was a period when the transferor spouse and transferee spouse had different main residences before they separated, they need to make a choice to either:\n\n\n\u2022treat one of the dwellings as the main residence of both of them for the period\n\u2022nominate the different dwellings as their main residences (and obtain a partial exemption on both).\n\n\n\n\nChoices relating to the main residence exemption generally need to be made by the day the person lodges their tax return for the income year they transfer or enter into the contract to sell the dwelling (or their interest in it) or another CGT event happens to it. In most cases, the way in which the tax return is prepared is sufficient evidence of that choice.\n\nFor the practical reasons of negotiating a property settlement, any choices the transferor spouse decides to make would generally be expected to be made before they transfer the dwelling (or their interest in it) to the transferee spouse.\n\nA signed statement could be provided by the transferor spouse to the transferee spouse at the time of the property settlement as evidence of the making of a choice. Such a statement would be evidence that the transferee spouse could use to support the calculation of any capital gain or capital loss they make when the dwelling is later disposed of or another CGT event happens to the dwelling.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Choices](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCHOICES%22&PiT=99991231235958#CHOICES)\n.\n\n**Example 103: choice made by transferor spouse to treat dwelling as their main residence**\n> At the time of negotiating their property settlement on the breakdown of their marriage in 2024, Calvin and Denise discuss with their advisers how to divide their joint assets.\n\n> When she was single, Denise had purchased a townhouse under a contract that was settled on 1 August 1999. She lived in it for 3 years.\n\n> On 14 August 2002, Denise and Calvin rented a flat and started living together as spouses. At that time, Denise began renting out her townhouse. After living together for 2 years in the flat, Denise and Calvin bought a house. They moved in on 25 September 2004, the date of settlement of the purchase contract.\n\n> Denise continued to rent out the townhouse.\n\n> In 2024, their relationship broke down. Denise and Calvin decided that Calvin would transfer his half share in the house to Denise (where she and their daughter would continue to live) and she would transfer the townhouse to Calvin (for him to live in) under a binding financial agreement.\n\n> Because the townhouse had been Denise's main residence, she could choose to continue to treat it as such for up to 6 years of any period of absence.\n\n> In negotiating their binding financial agreement, Denise provided Calvin with a signed statement which indicated she had chosen to treat the townhouse as her main residence for the 2 years between the time she moved out and the time they bought the house together.\n\n> Because the 'home first used to produce income' rule applies, Calvin is taken to have acquired the townhouse for its market value on 14 August 2002 and will qualify for a partial main residence exemption when he sells it. (The period from 1999 to 2002 is ignored from their combined period of ownership.)\n\n> The effect of Denise's choice is that the townhouse is exempt from CGT for the period between 14 August 2002 (when she moved out) and 25 September 2004 (when she and Calvin bought the house together). When Calvin sells it, he will get an exemption for that period as well as for the period he lived in it after the marriage broke down.\n\n> If Denise had not made the choice, Calvin would not get the exemption for the period from 14 August 2002 to 25 September 2004.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Dwellings transferred from a company or the trustee of a trust*\n\nIf a dwelling (or an interest in a dwelling) was transferred to you from a company or trustee of a trust, and the marriage or relationship breakdown rollover applies to the transfer, you are treated as having owned the dwelling while it was owned by the company or trustee. However, you can't get the main residence exemption during any part of the period that the company or trustee owned it (even if you lived in the dwelling during that time).\n\nTherefore, if a dwelling is transferred to you by a company or trustee as a result of your marriage or relationship breakdown, you will be entitled to the exemption only for the period after it was transferred when it was your main residence. You work out the proportion of your capital gain or capital loss that is exempt by dividing the period after the transfer that it was your main residence by the combined period you and the company or trustee owned it.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Real estate and main residence](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATREALESTATEANDMAINRESIDENCE%22&PiT=99991231235958#REALESTATEANDMAINRESIDENCE)\n.\n\n**Consequences of the rollover not applying**\n\nIf you and your spouse divide your property under a private or informal agreement (not because of a court order, a binding financial agreement, an arbitral award or another agreement or award referred to above), the marriage or relationship breakdown rollover does not apply.\n\nIf this is the case, you must take any capital gain or capital loss you make on the transfer of the asset into account in working out your net capital gain (or net capital losses carried forward to future years) in your tax return for that income year.\n\nThe spouse to whom the asset is transferred is taken to have acquired the asset at the time of transfer.\n\nSpecial rules may apply if a spouse receiving property does not pay anything for it, or if the amount paid by one spouse for property owned by the other is greater or less than the market value of the property and they are not dealing at arm's length. In these cases, the transferee is taken to have paid the market value of the property and the transferor is taken to have received the market value of the property.\n\nYou are said to be dealing at arm's length with someone if each of you acts independently and neither of you exercises influence or control over the other in connection with the transaction. It depends not only on the nature of your relationship but also the quality of the bargaining between you.\n\n**Example 104: rollover does not apply**\n> Laurie and Jennie separated after living in a relationship for 4 years. To avoid legal costs, they decided that they would divide their assets without involving solicitors.\n\n> During their relationship they had occupied a townhouse owned by Laurie. As part of their informal arrangement, they decided Laurie would keep it. They owned separate household items and decided each of them would keep whatever they had bought.\n\n> They also agreed that Laurie would transfer his half share of their rental property to Jennie in return for $6,000. Under the arrangement, Jennie would also become liable for the whole of the mortgage after the date of transfer.\n\n> Little or no bargaining took place between Laurie and Jennie and no other assets were transferred.\n\n> Jennie is taken to have paid the market value of Laurie's share of the rental property. (The $6,000 she actually paid and the mortgage liability she assumed from Laurie are ignored.) This is because:\n> \n> \n> \u2022a CGT rollover did not apply (as the transfer did not happen because of a court order or a relevant agreement or award)\n> \u2022Jennie and Laurie did not deal with each other at arm's length in connection with the transfer.\n\n> Laurie is taken to have received the market value of his share of the rental property at the time it was transferred to Jennie. This means, in working out his net capital gain for the income year he transferred the property to Jennie, he takes into account a capital gain or capital loss, based on the market value of his half share at that time.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Deceased estates\n\nIf you are a deceased person's legal personal representative or a beneficiary of a deceased estate, see this section to find out about the special CGT rules that apply.\n\n**On this page**\n\n\n\u2022[CGT and deceased estates](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCGTANDDECEASEDESTATES%22&PiT=99991231235958#CGTANDDECEASEDESTATES)\n\u2022[Capital gain or capital loss on death is disregarded](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCAPITALGAINORCAPITALLOSSONDEATHISDISREGARDED%22&PiT=99991231235958#CAPITALGAINORCAPITALLOSSONDEATHISDISREGARDED)\n\u2022[Assets which pass to the beneficiary or legal personal representative](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATASSETSWHICHPASSTOTHEBENEFICIARYORLEGALPERSONALREPRESENTATIVE%22&PiT=99991231235958#ASSETSWHICHPASSTOTHEBENEFICIARYORLEGALPERSONALREPRESENTATIVE)\n\u2022[Choosing the indexation method or the discount method](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCHOOSINGTHEINDEXATIONMETHODORTHEDISCOUNTMETHOD%22&PiT=99991231235958#CHOOSINGTHEINDEXATIONMETHODORTHEDISCOUNTMETHOD)\n\u2022[Joint tenants](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATJOINTTENANTS2%22&PiT=99991231235958#JOINTTENANTS2)\n\u2022[Unapplied net capital losses](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATUNAPPLIEDNETCAPITALLOSSES%22&PiT=99991231235958#UNAPPLIEDNETCAPITALLOSSES)\n\u2022[Life and remainder interests](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATLIFEANDREMAINDERINTERESTS%22&PiT=99991231235958#LIFEANDREMAINDERINTERESTS)\n\u2022[Trustee choice to be assessed on capital gains](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATTRUSTEECHOICETOBEASSESSEDONCAPITALGAINS%22&PiT=99991231235958#TRUSTEECHOICETOBEASSESSEDONCAPITALGAINS)\n\n\n\n\nWhen a person dies, the assets that make up their estate can:\n\n\n\u2022pass directly to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries), or\n\u2022pass directly to their legal personal representative (for example, their executor) who may dispose of the assets or pass them to the beneficiary (or beneficiaries).\n\n\n\n\nA beneficiary is a person entitled to assets of a deceased estate.

It will be disregarded if, when a person dies, an asset they owned passes:\n\n\n\u2022to their legal personal representative or to a beneficiary\n\u2022from their legal personal representative to a beneficiary.\n\n\n\n\n***Exceptions to this rule***\n\nA capital gain or capital loss is not disregarded if a post-CGT asset owned at the time of death passes from the deceased to a\n[tax-advantaged entity](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATTAXADVANTAGEDENTITY%22&PiT=99991231235958#TAXADVANTAGEDENTITY)\nor to a foreign resident. In these cases, a CGT event is taken to have happened to the asset just before the person died. The CGT event results in:\n\n\n\u2022a capital gain if the market value of the asset on the day the person died was more than the cost base of the asset\n\u2022a capital loss if the market value was less than the asset's reduced cost base.\n\n\n\n\nThese capital gains and losses should be taken into account in the deceased person's 'date of death tax return'. The date of death tax return is for the period from the start of the income year to the date of the person's death.\n\nHowever, any capital gain or capital loss from a testamentary gift of property can be disregarded if:\n\n\n\u2022the gift was made to a deductible gift recipient\n\u2022the gift would have been income tax deductible if it had not been a testamentary gift.\n\n\n\n\nThe condition that testamentary gifts of property must be valued at greater than $5,000 before the CGT exemption applies does not apply to gifts made on or after 1 July 2005.\n\n***Tax-advantaged entity***\n\nA tax-advantaged entity is:\n\n\n\u2022a tax-exempt entity, for example, a church or charity, or\n\u2022the trustee of\n\n\n-a complying superannuation fund\n-a complying approved deposit fund, or\n-a pooled superannuation trust, or\n\n\n\n\u2022a foreign resident.\n\n\n\n\n***Foreign resident beneficiary***\n\nIf a foreign resident is a beneficiary of a deceased's post CGT asset, any capital gain or capital loss is taken into account in preparing the deceased person's date of death tax return if:\n\n\n\u2022the deceased was an Australian resident when they died\n\u2022the asset is not\n[taxable Australian property](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATTAXABLEAUSTRALIANPROPERTY%22&PiT=99991231235958#TAXABLEAUSTRALIANPROPERTY)\nin the hands of the beneficiary.\n\n\n\n\n**Assets which pass to the beneficiary or legal personal representative**\n\n***Main residence***\n\nSpecial rules apply if the asset was the deceased person's or beneficiary's main residence, see\n[Inherited main residence](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATINHERITEDMAINRESIDENCE%22&PiT=99991231235958#INHERITEDMAINRESIDENCE)\nand\n[Flowchart 3.6](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATFLOWCHART3.6%22&PiT=99991231235958#FLOWCHART3.6)\n.\n\n***Other real estate***\n\nEven if the property was not the deceased person's main residence, special rules may mean you qualify for a full or partial exemption when you dispose of it, see\n[Inherited main residence](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATINHERITEDMAINRESIDENCE%22&PiT=99991231235958#INHERITEDMAINRESIDENCE)\nand\n[Flowchart 3.6](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATFLOWCHART3.6%22&PiT=99991231235958#FLOWCHART3.6)\n.\n\n***Other assets***\n\nIn administering and winding up a deceased estate, a legal personal representative may need to dispose of some or all of the assets of the estate. Assets disposed of in this way are subject to the normal rules and any capital gain the legal personal representative makes on the disposal is subject to CGT.\n\nSimilarly, it may be necessary for the legal personal representative to acquire an asset (for example, to satisfy a specific legacy made). Any capital gain or capital loss they make on disposal of that asset to the beneficiary is subject to the normal CGT rules.\n\nIf a beneficiary sells an asset they have inherited, the normal CGT rules also apply.\n\n***Acquisition of asset***\n\nIf you acquire an asset owned by a deceased person as their legal personal representative or beneficiary, you are taken to have acquired the asset on the day the person died. If that was before 20 September 1985, you disregard any capital gain or capital loss you make from the asset.\n\n***Cost base of asset***\n\n*Assets acquired by the deceased person before 20 September 1985*\n\nIf the deceased person acquired their asset before 20 September 1985, the first element of your cost base and reduced cost base (that is, the amount taken to have been paid for the asset) is the market value of the asset on the day the person died.\n\nIf, before they died, a person made a major improvement to a pre-CGT asset on or after 20 September 1985, the improvement is not treated as a separate asset by the legal personal representative or beneficiary. They are taken to have acquired a single asset. The cost base of this asset, when the legal personal representative or beneficiary acquires it, is equal to the cost base of the major improvement on the day the person died plus the market value of the pre-CGT asset (excluding the improvement) on the day the person died.\n\n*Assets acquired by the deceased person on or after 20 September 1985*\n\nIf a deceased person acquired their asset on or after 20 September 1985, the first element of your cost base and reduced cost base is taken to be the deceased person's cost base and reduced cost base of the asset on the day the person died.\n\nThere is an exception if the asset is a dwelling and certain conditions are met. See\n[Cost to you of acquiring the dwelling](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCOSTTOYOUOFACQUIRINGTHEDWELLING%22&PiT=99991231235958#COSTTOYOUOFACQUIRINGTHEDWELLING)\n.\n\nIf the deceased person died before 21 September 1999, and you choose the indexation method to work out the capital gain when you dispose of the asset (or when another CGT event happens), you index the first element of the cost base from the date the deceased person acquired it up until 21 September 1999.\n\nIf the deceased person died on or after 21 September 1999, you can't use the indexation method and, when you dispose of the asset, you must recalculate the first element of your cost base to leave out any indexation that was included in the deceased's cost base.\n\nIf you are the trustee of a Special Disability Trust, the first element of your cost base and reduced cost base is the market value of the asset on the day the person died.\n\n***Expenditure incurred by a legal personal representative***\n\nAs a beneficiary, you can include in your cost base (and reduced cost base) any expenditure the legal personal representative (for example, the executor) would have been able to include in their cost base if they had sold the asset instead of distributing it to you. You can include the expenditure on the date they incurred it.\n\nFor example, if an executor incurs costs in confirming the validity of the deceased's will, these costs form part of the cost base of the estate's assets.\n\n**Example 105: transfer of an asset from the executor to a beneficiary**\n> Maria died on 13 October 2001, leaving 2 assets, both acquired after 19 September 1985: a parcel of 2,000 shares in Bounderby Ltd and a vacant block of land. Giovanni was appointed executor of the estate (the legal personal representative).\n\n> When the assets are transferred to Giovanni as legal personal representative, he disregards any capital gain or capital loss. Giovanni disposes of (sells) the shares to pay Maria's outstanding debts. As the shares are not transferred to a beneficiary, any capital gain or capital loss on this disposal must be included on the tax return for Maria's deceased estate.\n\n> When all debts and tax have been paid, Giovanni transfers the land to Maria's beneficiary, Antonio, and pays the conveyancing fee of $5,000. As the land is transferred to a beneficiary, any capital gain or capital loss to date is disregarded. The first element of Antonio's cost base is taken as Maria's cost base on the date of her death. Antonio is also entitled to include in his cost base the $5,000 Giovanni spent on the conveyancing.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Choosing the indexation method or the discount method**\n\nIf the deceased person died before 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999 and you dispose of the asset (as legal personal representative or beneficiary) after that date, there are 2 ways of calculating your capital gain. You can use either the indexation method or the discount method, whichever gives you the better result. However, the CGT discount is only available if you are an individual, a trust or a complying superannuation entity.\n\nElements of an asset's cost base can be indexed only if you own the asset for at least 12 months before disposing of it. For the purposes of this 12-month ownership test you are taken to have acquired the asset when the deceased acquired it, not from the date of their death.\n\nFor the CGT discount to apply, you must have acquired the asset at least 12 months before disposing of it. For the purposes of this 12-month ownership test, you are taken to have acquired the asset at one of the following times:\n\n\n\u2022for pre-CGT assets, the date the deceased died\n\u2022for post-CGT assets, the date the deceased acquired it.\n\n\n**Example 106: indexation and CGT discount**\n> Leonard acquired a property on 14 November 1998 for $126,000. He died on 6 August 1999 and left the property to Gladys. She sold the property on 6 July 2023 for $240,000. The property was not the main residence of either Leonard or Gladys.\n\n> Although Gladys acquired the property on 6 August 1999, for the purpose of determining whether she had owned the property for at least 12 months, she was taken to have acquired it on 14 November 1998 (the day Leonard acquired it).\n\n> At the time of disposal, Gladys had owned the property for more than 12 months. As she is taken to have acquired it before 11:45 am AEST on 21 September 1999 and disposed of it after that date, Gladys could choose to index the cost base. However, if the discount method would give her a better result, she could choose to claim the CGT discount.\n\n> If Gladys chooses the discount method she would have to exclude from the first element of her cost base the amount that represented the indexation that had accrued to Leonard up until the time he died.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a foreign or temporary resident and taxable Australian property passes to you from the deceased, you may not be able to apply the CGT discount if you are taken to have acquired the asset after 8 May 2012.\n\nFor more information, see\n[CGT discount for foreign residents](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/capital-gains-tax/foreign-residents-and-capital-gains-tax/cgt-discount-for-foreign-residents)\n.\n\n***Collectables and personal use assets***\n\nA post-CGT collectable or personal use asset is still treated as such when you receive it as a beneficiary or the legal personal representative of the estate.\n\n**Joint tenants**\n\nIf 2 or more people acquire a property asset together, it can be either as tenants in common or as joint tenants.\n\nIf a tenant in common dies, their interest in the property is an asset of their deceased estate. This means it can be transferred only to a beneficiary of the estate or be sold (or otherwise dealt with) by the legal personal representative of the estate.\n\nIf one of the joint tenants dies, their interest in the property passes to the surviving joint tenants. It is not an asset of the deceased estate.\n\nFor CGT purposes, if you are a joint tenant you are treated as if you are a tenant in common owning equal shares in the asset. However, if you are a joint tenant and another joint tenant dies, on that date their interest in the asset is taken to pass in equal shares to you and any other surviving joint tenants, as if their interest is an asset of their deceased estate and you are beneficiaries.\n\nThis means that if the dwelling was the deceased's main residence, you may be entitled to the main residence exemption (see\n[Inherited main residence](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATINHERITEDMAINRESIDENCE%22&PiT=99991231235958#INHERITEDMAINRESIDENCE)\n) for the interest you acquired from them.\n\nIf the joint tenant who dies acquired their interest in the asset on or after 20 September 1985, the first element of the cost base of the interest you acquire from them is the cost base of their interest on the day they died, divided by the number of joint tenants (including you) who acquire it. The first element of the reduced cost base of the interest you acquire from them is worked out similarly.\n\n**Example 107: surviving joint tenants**\n> In 2000, Ming and Lee buy a residential property for $250,000 as joint tenants. Each one is taken to have a 50% interest in it. On 1 May 2002, Lee dies.\n\n> On 1 May 2002, Ming is taken to have acquired Lee's interest for an amount equal to Lee's cost base on that day.\n\n> If Ming uses the property as his main residence after Lee dies, he may be entitled to the main residence exemption (see\n> [Real estate and main residence](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATREALESTATEANDMAINRESIDENCE%22&PiT=99991231235958#REALESTATEANDMAINRESIDENCE)\n> ) for the interest he acquired from Lee as well as for his original interest.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the joint tenant who dies acquired their interest in the asset before 20 September 1985, the first element of the cost base of the interest you acquire from them is the market value of their interest on the day they died, divided by the number of joint tenants (including you) who acquire it. The first element of the reduced cost base of the interest you acquire from them is worked out similarly.\n\nFor the indexation and discount methods to apply, you must have owned the asset (or your share of it) for at least 12 months. As a surviving joint tenant, for the purposes of this 12-month test, you are taken to have acquired the deceased's interest in the asset (or your share of it) at the time the deceased person acquired it.\n\n**Example 108: CGT and joint tenants**\n> Trevor and Kylie acquired land as joint tenants before 20 September 1985. Trevor died in October 2012. For CGT purposes, Kylie is taken to have acquired Trevor's interest in the land at its market value at the date of his death.\n\n> Kylie holds her original 50% interest as a pre-CGT asset, and the inherited 50% interest as a post-CGT asset which she is taken to have acquired at its market value at the date of Trevor's death.\n\n> If Kylie sold the land within 12 months of Trevor's death, she would qualify for the CGT discount on any capital gain she makes on her post-CGT interest. She qualifies for the CGT discount because, for the purposes of the 12-month ownership test, she is taken to have acquired Trevor's interest at the time he acquired it, which was before 20 September 1985.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Unapplied net capital losses**\n\nIf the deceased had any unapplied net capital losses when they died, these can't be passed on to you as the beneficiary or legal personal representative for you to offset against any net capital gains.\n\n**Life and remainder interests**\n\nThere may be CGT consequences on the creation, surrender, expiry or disposal of a life interest or remainder interest.\n\nFor more information, see Taxation Ruling\n[TR 2006/14](/law/view/document?LocID=%22TXR%2FTR200614%2FNAT%2FATO%22&PiT=99991231235958#ATO)\n*Income tax: capital gains tax: consequences of creating life and remainder interests in property and of later events affecting those interests.*\n\n**Trustee choice to be assessed on capital gains**\n\nThe trustee of a resident trust may choose (if permitted by the trust deed) to be assessed on a capital gain of the trust. This is allowed provided no beneficiary has received any amount referable to the gain during 2023\u201324 or within 2 months of the end of 2023-24 income year. The choice must be made in respect of the whole capital gain.\n\nThis is similar to (and replaced) the choice available to the trustee of a testamentary trust under the law prior to the 2010\u201311 amendments but is not limited to those trustees. Under the previous law (that applied from 2005\u201306) the trustee of a resident testamentary trust could choose to be assessed on the capital gains for an income year which would otherwise be assessed to an income beneficiary (or the trustee on their behalf).\n\nThe trustee will be able to make the choice if, for example, under the terms of the trust the income beneficiary can't benefit from the capital gains. Only the trustee can make this choice.\n\nIf the trustee makes a choice in respect of a capital gain then:\n\n\n\u2022the trustee will be assessed on the capital gain under section 99 or 99A, as appropriate\n\u2022the capital gain is not taken into account in working out any beneficiary's net capital gain for 2023\u201324.\n\n\n**Example 109: trustee choice to be assessed**\n> Marcia is entitled to all the income of a resident trust for the duration of her life. Under the terms of the trust deed, the trust would be wound up on her death and the corpus distributed to Trevor.\n\n> While Marcia is alive, the trustee disposes of some shares in the trust and makes a capital gain. Marcia is not entitled under the terms of the trust to receive the proceeds from the disposal of the shares as Trevor is the capital beneficiary.\n\n> As the capital gain is included in the net income of the trust for tax purposes, Marcia may be assessed on her share of the capital gain even though she is not entitled to benefit from the gain. The trustee can make a choice to be assessed on the share of the capital gain that would otherwise be assessed to Marcia.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Earnout and deferred consideration arrangements\n\nExplains what earnout and deferred consideration arrangements are.\n\n**On this page**\n\n\n\u2022[Earnout and deferred consideration](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATEARNOUTANDDEFERREDCONSIDERATION%22&PiT=99991231235958#EARNOUTANDDEFERREDCONSIDERATION)\n\u2022[Look-through earnout rights](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATLOOKTHROUGHEARNOUTRIGHTS%22&PiT=99991231235958#LOOKTHROUGHEARNOUTRIGHTS)\n\u2022[Amendments](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATAMENDMENTS%22&PiT=99991231235958#AMENDMENTS)\n\u2022[Extension to period of review](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATEXTENSIONTOPERIODOFREVIEW%22&PiT=99991231235958#EXTENSIONTOPERIODOFREVIEW)\n\u2022[Penalties and interest](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATPENALTIESANDINTEREST%22&PiT=99991231235958#PENALTIESANDINTEREST)\n\u2022[Remaking choices affected by look-through earnout rights](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATREMAKINGCHOICESAFFECTEDBYLOOKTHROUGHEARNOUTRIGHTS%22&PiT=99991231235958#REMAKINGCHOICESAFFECTEDBYLOOKTHROUGHEARNOUTRIGHTS)\n\u2022[Effect of look-through earnout rights on CGT Small business concessions](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATEFFECTOFLOOKTHROUGHEARNOUTRIGHTSONCGTSMALLBUSINESSCONCESSIONS%22&PiT=99991231235958#EFFECTOFLOOKTHROUGHEARNOUTRIGHTSONCGTSMALLBUSINESSCONCESSIONS)\n\u2022[Allocated cost amount (ACA) affected by look-through earnout rights](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATALLOCATEDCOSTAMOUNTAFFECTEDBYLOOKTHROUGHEARNOUTRIGHTS%22&PiT=99991231235958#ALLOCATEDCOSTAMOUNTAFFECTEDBYLOOKTHROUGHEARNOUTRIGHTS)\n\n\n\n\n**Earnout and deferred consideration**\n\nEarnout and deferred consideration arrangements are often employed as a way of structuring the sale of a business (including business assets or an interest in an entity carrying on a business) to deal with uncertainty about its value. They create a contingent right to a future payment (or other financial benefit) that is unascertainable at the time the right is created.\n\nOften the sale contract provides for:\n\n\n\u2022an initial lump sum payment by the buyer\n\u2022a right to subsequent financial benefits that are contingent on satisfying conditions about the performance of the business, market prices, or meeting certain milestones.\n\n\n\n\nIn a standard earnout or deferred consideration arrangement, the buyer agrees to pay the seller additional amounts if the relevant conditions are met. The seller holds the contractual right.\n\nIn a reverse earnout or deferred consideration arrangement, the seller agrees to pay amounts to the buyer if the relevant conditions are not met. The buyer holds the contractual right.\n\nSome earnout and deferred consideration arrangements combine the features of both a standard arrangement and a reverse arrangement as both the buyer and seller may be obligated to provide financial benefits which are dependent on contingencies.\n\nLegislation that became law on 25 February 2016 provides for look-through CGT treatment of certain earnout arrangements entered into on or after 24 April 2015. Under the look-through CGT treatment in Subdivision 118-I, capital gains or losses associated with look-through earnout rights are disregarded, and the financial benefits of the arrangement are instead applied to the capital proceeds or cost base of the underlying asset.\n\nThe tax considerations for earnouts and deferred consideration arrangements outlined in this section are general in nature and may not be relevant to all sale transactions that include earnout or deferred consideration arrangements. This section does not address arrangements such as a discount for prompt payment, the provision by the seller of an indemnity, warranty, or guarantee or financing arrangements which result in an equity interest being issued by an entity. The tax outcomes for such transactions will be dictated by the nature of the rights in question and the circumstances of the wider transaction of which they form part.\n\n**Look-through earnout rights**\n\nLook-through CGT treatment applies to a contractual right to future financial benefits created under an earnout or deferred consideration arrangement if:\n\n\n\u2022the contractual right was created on or after 24 April 2015\n\u2022the contractual right is a right to future financial benefits that are not reasonably ascertainable at the time the right is created\n\u2022the right was created under an arrangement involving the disposal of a CGT asset\n\u2022the disposal caused CGT event A1 to happen\n\u2022just before the CGT event, the CGT asset was an active asset of the entity which disposed of the asset\n\u2022all of the financial benefits under the right are to be provided within 5 years after the end of the income year in which the CGT event happened\n\u2022the financial benefits must be contingent on the economic performance of the CGT asset or a business for which it is expected that the CGT asset be an active asset for the period to which those financial benefits relate\n\u2022the value of those financial benefits reasonably relates to that economic performance, and\n\u2022the parties to the arrangement deal with each other at arm's length in making the arrangement.\n\n\n\n\nUnder the look-through CGT treatment:\n\n\n\u2022the capital gains or losses in respect of look-through earnout rights are disregarded\n\u2022for the buyer, any financial benefit provided (or received) under a look-through earnout right increase (or decrease) the cost base and the reduced cost base of the underlying asset\n\u2022for the seller, any financial benefit received (or provided) under the look-through earnout right increase (or decrease) the capital proceeds from the disposal of the underlying asset\n\u2022capital losses arising from the disposal of assets to which look-through earnout rights relate are temporarily disregarded until and to the extent that they become certain, that is, the capital losses could not be further reduced by you receiving one or more financial benefits. Once the losses become certain, they are available from the income year in which they were originally incurred, and not when the amount of the losses became certain.\n\n\n\n\nWhere an earnout or deferred consideration arrangement does not satisfy the above conditions, the contractual right or rights created under the arrangement are considered separate CGT assets.\n\nTaxpayers who are subject to the Taxation of Financial Arrangement (TOFA) provisions in Division 230 of the ITAA 1997 should consider whether their earnout or deferred consideration arrangement is a 'financial arrangement' subject to those provisions. Earnout and deferred consideration arrangements contingent on the economic performance of the relevant business are generally excluded from the TOFA provisions. However, the TOFA provisions may apply to certain types of earnout or deferred consideration arrangements. Where the TOFA provisions apply to an earnout or deferred consideration arrangement that also satisfies the definition of a look-through earnout right in Subdivision 118-I, TOFA will apply in priority to look-through CGT treatment.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Guide to taxation of financial arrangements (TOFA)](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/corporate-tax-measures-and-assurance/taxation-of-financial-arrangements-tofa/in-detail/guide-to-the-taxation-of-financial-arrangements-tofa)\n\nIf you have an earnout arrangement that doesn't satisfy the requirements for look-through treatment under Subdivision 118-I or TOFA treatment under Division 230 of the ITAA 1997, and you are unsure of the tax treatment of your arrangement, you can request an early engagement discussion or seek a ruling.\n\n**Example 110: the look-through CGT treatment**\n> This example does not consider any other CGT concessions that may be available.\n\n> A business is sold on the following terms:\n> \n> \n> \u2022the buyer agrees to pay an initial upfront amount of $800,000\n> \u2022the buyer agrees to pay the seller 50% of the revenue above $500,000 per annum for the next 3 income years.\n\n> The market value of the earnout rights at the time of the contract is $300,000 in total.\n\n> Revenue for the business in the following 3 income years is $700,000, $800,000 and $700,000. Therefore, the buyer makes additional payments of $100,000, $150,000 and $100,000 to the seller.\n\n> The following assumptions are made:\n> \n> \n> \u2022the seller's cost base for the business is $700,000\n> \u2022all the conditions of a look-through earnout right are met\n> \u2022the seller has no capital losses brought forward from prior years\n> \u2022the seller is not eligible for any CGT discount\n> \u2022no other expenditure has been incurred\n> \u2022the TOFA rules don't apply to the seller or buyer.\n> \n> \n> *Outcomes for the seller and buyer*\n>   \n> \n> | Year | Seller | Buyer |\n> | **0** | CGT event A1 happens. The seller's capital proceeds are $800,000. The cost base is $700,000. The capital gain is $100,000. | The buyer acquires an asset with a cost base of $800,000. |\n> | **1** | Financial benefits of $100,000 received. Increase Year 0 capital proceeds by $100,000 to $900,000, which results in a revised capital gain or $200,000. | The buyer provides financial benefits of $100,000. The buyer's cost base is increased to $900,000. |\n> | **2** | Financial benefits of $150,000 received. Increase Year 0 capital proceeds by $150,000 to $1,050,000, which results in a revised capital gain of $350,000. | The buyer provides financial benefits of $150,000. The buyer's cost base is increased to $1,050,000. |\n> | **3** | Financial benefits of $100,000 received. Increase Year 0 capital proceeds by $100,000 to $1,150,000, which results in a revised capital gain of $450,000. | The buyer provides financial benefits of $100,000. The buyer's cost base is increased to $1,150,000. |\n\n> Under the look-through CGT treatment:\n> \n> \n> \u2022a valuation of the earnout rights is not required\n> \u2022the CGT consequences for the seller is reported and assessed when the financial benefits are received or provided.\n> \u2022the cost base of the buyer reflects the financial benefits provided by the buyer, including the benefits provided under the earnout arrangement.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Amendments**\n\nTo apply look-through CGT treatment, you may need to seek an amendment to your net capital gain (or capital losses carried forward amount) of an earlier income year. You may be able to seek such amendment by completing labels 7F and 7G of the CGT schedule.\n\n**Extension to period of review**\n\nFinancial benefits under a look-through earnout right can be provided or received up to 5 years after the end of the income year in which the CGT event occurred. In some cases, the period of review may have passed before you have provided or received the financial benefit requiring the amendment.\n\nAccordingly, the period of review for all entities' tax-related liabilities affected by a look-through earnout right is the later of the period of review that would normally apply and 4 years after the end of the income year in which the last possible financial benefit could be received or provided under the look-through earnout right. This includes liabilities in subsequent years and tax related liabilities for taxes other than income tax.\n\n**Penalties and interest**\n\nYou will not be subject to shortfall interest charge on additional tax that you must pay as a result of providing or receiving financial benefits under a look-through earnout right. This is provided you request an amendment to the relevant income tax assessment by the due date for lodgement of the income year in which you received or provided those financial benefits.\n\nHowever, the above exception to the shortfall interest charge does not apply to the extent you accessed a concession for which you are ultimately not eligible as a result of receiving or providing those financial benefits.\n\nThe Commissioner is not liable to pay interest on any overpayment of tax which results from financial benefits being provided or received under a look-through earnout right.\n\n**Remaking choices affected by look-through earnout rights**\n\nYou can remake any choice previously made where the choice relates to a capital gain or loss that can be affected by financial benefits provided or received under a look-through earnout right. However, you need to remake the choice at or before the time you are required to lodge your income tax return for the income year in which the financial benefit is provided or received.\n\nTherefore, you may need to reconsider any choices and your entitlement to concessions in light of financial benefits provided or received to ensure that the resulting gain, loss or cost base reflects any concessions that are available. Alternatively, you can wait until it is clear whether or not you will be finally eligible for the concession before making any choice.\n\nAdditionally, if you have made contributions to a superannuation fund in order to access a concession, you can't withdraw these contributions if the concessions are no longer available.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Choices](/law/view/document?LocID=%22SAV%2FGCGT%2FATCHOICES%22&PiT=99991231235958#CHOICES)\n\n**Effect of look-through earnout rights on small business CGTconcessions**\n\nThe future financial benefits received or provided under a look-through earnout right may affect your eligibility for some CGT concessions. It may also impact on the time allowed for you to take certain actions to satisfy the eligibility requirements.\n\nFor more information, see\n[Small business CGT concessions](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/income-deductions-and-concessions/income-and-deductions-for-business/concessions-offsets-and-rebates/small-business-cgt-concessions/small-business-cgt-concessions-eligibility-conditions/cgt-concessions-eligibility-overview)\n.\n\n**Allocated cost amount (ACA) affected by look-through earnout rights**\n\nSubsection 705-65(5B) requires consolidated groups to revise the ACA amount of an entity that joins the group to take account of subsequent money or property provided in respect of the acquisition of a membership interest in the entity where the subsequent money or property was not taken into account in working out the ACA when the entity joined the group.\n\nConsolidated groups may need to revise the entry ACA of an entity that joins the group if:\n\n\n\u2022the membership interest in the entity was acquired under a look-through earnout arrangement\n\u2022subsequent financial benefits were provided or received under the look-through earnout right\n\u2022the subsequent financial benefits were not considered when working out the ACA when the entity joined the group.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, see\n[Consolidation](https://https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/corporate-tax-measures-and-assurance/consolidation)\n\n\n\n### \n\n### References\n\n  \n\n**ATO references:**NO QC 101683\n**Guide to capital gains tax 2024**\n\n|  | **Date:** | **Version:** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 1 July 2000 | [Updated document](/law/view/document?docid=SAV/GCGT/00007&PiT=20000701000001) |\n|  | 1 July 2001 | [Updated document](/law/view/document?docid=SAV/GCGT/00007&PiT=20010701000001) |\n|  | 1 July 2002 | [Updated document](/law/view/document?docid=SAV/GCGT/00006&PiT=20020701000001) |\n|  | 1 July 2003 | [Updated document](/law/view/document?docid=SAV/GCGT/00008&PiT=20030701000001) |\n|  | 1 July 2004 | [Updated document](/law/view/document?docid=SAV/GCGT/00007&PiT=20040701000001) |\n|  | 1 July 2005 | [Updated document](/law/view/document?docid=SAV/GCGT/00007&PiT=20050701000001) |\n|  | 1 July 2006 | [Updated document](/law/view/document?docid=SAV/GCGT/00007&PiT=20060701000001) |\n|  | 1 July 2007 | [Updated document](/law/view/document?docid=SAV/GCGT/00007&PiT=20070701000001) |\n|  | 1 July 2008 | [Updated document](/law/view/document?docid=SAV/GCGT/00007&PiT=20080701000001) |\n|  | 1 July 2009 | [Updated document](/law/view/document?docid=SAV/GCGT/00007&PiT=20090701000001) |\n|  | 1 July 2010 | [Updated document](/law/view/document?docid=SAV/GCGT/00007&PiT=20100701000001) |\n|  | 1 July 2011 | [Updated document](/law/view/document?docid=SAV/GCGT/00007&PiT=20110701000001) |\n|  | 1 July 2012 | [Updated document](/law/view/document?docid=SAV/GCGT/00007&PiT=20120701000001) |\n|  | 1 July 2013 | [Updated document](/law/view/document?docid=SAV/GCGT/00007&PiT=20130701000001) |\n|  | 1 July 2014 | [Updated document](/law/view/document?docid=SAV/GCGT/00007&PiT=20140701000001) |\n|  | 1 July 2015 | [Updated document](/law/view/document?docid=SAV/GCGT/00008&PiT=20150701000001) |\n|  | 1 July 2016 | [Updated document](/law/view/document?docid=SAV/GCGT/00008&PiT=20160701000001) |\n|  | 1 July 2017 | [Updated document](/law/view/document?docid=SAV/GCGT/00008&PiT=20170701000001) |\n|  | 1 July 2018 | [Updated document](/law/view/document?docid=SAV/GCGT/00008&PiT=20180701000001) |\n|  | 1 July 2019 | [Updated document](/law/view/document?docid=SAV/GCGT/00008&PiT=20190701000001) |\n|  | 1 July 2020 | [Updated document](/law/view/document?docid=SAV/GCGT/00008&PiT=20200701000001) |\n|  | 1 July 2021 | [Updated document](/law/view/document?docid=SAV/GCGT/00007&PiT=20210701000001) |\n|  | 1 July 2022 | [Updated document](/law/view/document?docid=SAV/GCGT/00006&PiT=20220701000001) |\n| You are here | 1 July 2023 | [Current document](/law/view/document?docid=SAV/GCGT/00006&PiT=20230701000001) |\n\n\n\n\n",
